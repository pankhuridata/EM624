Exercise 01

Description: Write a program named exchange.py that will convert an amount of US dollars into a currency of the user’s choice. You must find the exchange rate for your chosen currency and input it to your program.

Input:  The user should be prompted for three inputs, using three separate raw_input statements (as in EX00):
How many US Dollars do you want to exchange? 		[ user input, example: 100 ]
Enter the name of the currency you are converting dollars to: 	[ example: rupees ]
What is the exchange rate? 						[ example: 68 ]

Output:  The input dollar amount, currency type, and amount of the currency that is equivalent to the input number of dollars, with appropriate description. Example:
	You can exchange 100 U.S. dollars for 6811 rupees

Procedure:
1.	Within a loop (as in EX00), prompt the user for the number of US Dollars xxxxx. Check if the input is numeric using the Python built-in function string.isdigit() (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html). If not, start the whole loop all over (using the statement ‘continue’). Be aware that isdigit() considers numbers only pure numerical values (no ‘-‘ or ‘.’). Your program will therefore take only integers as input numerical values
2.	Prompt the user for the name of currency he/she is converting the US Dollars into
3.	Prompt the user for the exchange rate rrrrr: that is, one US dollar = rrrrr units of the chosen currency. Check if the input is numeric using the Python built-in function string.isdigit(). If not, start the whole loop all over
4.	Calculate the number of the chosen currency represented by the input number of U.S. dollars
5.	Print the results, leaving a blank line before, for readability. A blank line before your actual printing can be printed with a separate print statement:
print ()
print (‘xyzxyzxyz’)
Or by using the \n newline notation:
print (‘\n xyzxyzxyz’)
