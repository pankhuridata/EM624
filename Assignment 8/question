Exercise 8: Web page mining
Assignment Specification

Description: This program will extract data from a web page and perform some analysis.

Input: No user provided input. Data will be collected from any news website.

Output: 
Print the headlines
Generate a wordcloud for the words/bigrams in the headlines
Calculate the sentiment
Write an interpretation of the results
See details in the Procedure.

Procedure:
1. Import the needed libraries
2. Define the target URL and open it
3. Load the page into your “soup” (if you are using Beautifulsoup)
4. Create an empty list to host the list of words from the headlines and then populate it
5. Transform the story heading/headlines into a string first and a list then
6. Remove from the list you created all the non-semantically relevant words (the “stopwords”), using the attached file “stopwords_en.txt” for the list of stopwords. Feel free to update the list, adding words 
that may be too frequent and – in your opinion – not too relevant (explaining the reason why you want to remove them). Filter out non-alphabetical elements and perform all the other preliminary cleaning on the text that you may require
7. Looping into the list of clean headlines, print the headlines with the highest and lowest sentiment (3 each)
8. Extract bigram, generating a separate list. Consider bigrams 2 words appearing together more than 2 times in the whole text. Bigrams will be like “word1_word2”, meaning you will create a new string composed by the 2 words, separated by an underscore (“_”)
9. Merge the list of single words with the list of bigrams
10. Create a wordcloud with the resulting list. If wordcloud is not available on your computer, either use an online option (see previous assignments) or calculate the sentiment as in previous assignments
