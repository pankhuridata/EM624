Kolkata Municipal Corporation all set to reopen quarantine units and safe homes amid surge in Covid cases,https://www.indiatoday.in/cities/kolkata/story/kolkata-municipal-corporation-all-set-to-reopen-quarantine-units-and-safe-homes-amid-surge-in-covid-cases-1868711-2021-10-24?utm_source=rss,,,,Kolkata Municipal Corporation all set to reopen quarantine units and safe homes amid surge in Covid cases,,10/24/21 7:21,"The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has recently decided to reopen quarantine units and safe homes in the wake of a steady rise in Covid cases in the city. Reportedly, the civic body held an urgent meeting on Friday to discuss a strategy on how to keep a check on the spread or Covid transmission in the city. A decision has been taken by the authorities to keep its fleet of ambulances ready for critical patients. Along with this, KMC has also asked to keep a sufficient number of hearse vans ready, keeping in mind the steady rise in Covid cases in the city. According to a report published in the Times of India (TOI), the KMC has decided to reopen a quarantine centre at Champamoni maternity home. It has also decided to reopen two safe houses, including one in a commercial building located near Science City and another at Cossipore. Safety measures taken by KMC, children on priority The safe home at Cossipore will specifically focus on children and women and will give shelter to infected children and their mothers. A KMC health department official was quoted by TOI as saying that special attention is given to the health of children in Covid prone areas. Though the Covid infection rate is low in children, chances cannot be taken and that is why the condition of children is being continuously monitored in any household where one or more members have tested Covid positive, he added. The KMC health department may also convert Uttirno, a state government-owned building at Alipore, into a safe house for children and their mothers, TOI revealed in its report. Meanwhile, the civic authorities have also decided to resume the sanitization drive across the city. Along with this, the KMC has decided to intensify the swab collection facility for RT-PCR tests or Covid tests at the urban primary health clinics. According to a medical officer, currently, there are 33 urban primary health centres across the city where RT-PCR tests are being conducted.

Residents in swaths of the province will be allowed to attend events like hockey games, concerts and weddings without any limits on numbers, but capacity will be capped at 50 per cent in areas where vaccination rates are low, including parts of the Fraser, Northern and Interior health regions. Attendees at all organized events in B.C. will be required to wear face coverings and show proof of COVID-19 vaccination. The move was eagerly anticipated by businesses, including those that require bookings well in advance for events like weddings. Harpal Sooch, owner of the Grand Taj Banquet Hall in Surrey, said he's cautiously optimistic about an uptick in business even as most large banquets were cancelled and won't be going ahead until next summer. ""This is my bread and butter for me and my family. Same thing for my partner, and same thing with all the banquet halls that are mostly run by families. We were closed for 15 months,"" he said of the toll on his finances. Sooch said the hall has been booked for two upcoming gatherings for Diwali ‚Äî one next Saturday and another two weeks later ‚Äî and he's hoping the business will start thriving again as more people return to socializing as usual. But Sooch said not everyone is ready for pre-pandemic-type parties while they still need to wear masks, especially seniors waiting for booster shots and families with children under 12 who can't yet be vaccinated. ""They're not getting into it. But hopefully everything goes on so by next summer we'll be fine,"" he said. ""That's what we're hoping for."" Heidi Tworek, a professor who specializes in health communications at the University of British Columbia's School of Public Policy and Global Affairs, said employers, businesses expecting more customers and even individuals inviting someone over for dinner should expect a range of reactions because the lack of regular contact with people after nearly two years will have impacted some people's mental health.

Residents in swaths of the province will be allowed to attend events like hockey games, concerts and weddings without any limits on numbers, but capacity will be capped at 50 per cent in areas where vaccination rates are low, including parts of the Fraser, Northern and Interior health regions. Attendees at all organized events in B.C. will be required to wear face coverings and show proof of COVID-19 vaccination. The move was eagerly anticipated by businesses, including those that require bookings well in advance for events like weddings.

Crew voiced safety fears before fatal shooting on set of Alec Baldwin film,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/crew-voiced-safety-fears-before-fatal-shooting-on-set-of-alec-baldwin-film-1.4709280?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"Hours before actor Alec Baldwin fired a fatal gunshot from a prop gun, a camera crew walked off the job in protest at conditions and production issues that included safety concerns. Disputes in the production of the Western film Rust began almost from the start in early October and culminated with seven crew members walking off several hours before 42-year-old cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed. The crew members had expressed their discontent with issues ranging from safety procedures to their accommodation, according to one of those who left. At a rehearsal on the film set at the Bonanza Creek Ranch outside Santa Fe on Thursday, the gun Mr Baldwin used was one of three that a firearms specialist, or ‚Äúarmourer‚Äù, had set on a cart outside the building where a scene was being rehearsed, according to court records. The documents indicate that an assistant director, Dave Halls, grabbed a prop gun off the cart and handed it to Mr Baldwin, indicating incorrectly that the weapon did not contain live rounds by yelling ‚Äúcold gun‚Äù. When Mr Baldwin pulled the trigger, he unwittingly killed Ms Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza, who was standing behind her inside a wooden, chapel-like building. Mr Baldwin (63), who is known for his roles in 30 Rock and The Hunt For Red October as well as his impressions of former US president Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, has described the killing as a ‚Äútragic accident‚Äù. He was a producer on Rust. Panic A 911 call that alerted authorities to the shooting hints at the panic on the film set, as detailed in a recording released by the Santa Fe County Regional Emergency Communications Centre. ‚ÄúWe had two people accidentally shot on a movie set by a prop gun, we need help immediately,‚Äù script supervisor Mamie Mitchell told an emergency dispatcher. ‚ÄúWe were rehearsing and it went off, and I ran out, we all ran out.‚Äù The call handler asked if the gun was loaded with a real bullet. ‚ÄúI cannot tell you. We have two injuries,‚Äù Ms Mitchell replied. ‚ÄúAnd this (expletive) AD (assistant director) that yelled at me at lunch, asking about revisions... He‚Äôs supposed to check the guns. He‚Äôs responsible for what happens on the set.‚Äù Court records say that Mr Halls grabbed the firearm from the cart and took it to the actor, also unaware that it was loaded with live rounds, a detective wrote in a search warrant application. It was unclear how many rounds were fired. Armourer Hannah Gutierrez removed a shell casing from the gun after the shooting, and turned the weapon over to police when they arrived, the court records say. Guns used in film-making are sometimes real weapons that can fire either bullets or blanks, which are gunpowder charges intended to produce little more than a flash and a bang. Examine New Mexico workplace safety investigators are examining whether film industry standards for gun safety were followed during production of Rust. The Los Angeles Times, citing two crew members it did not name, reported that five days before the shooting, Baldwin‚Äôs stunt double accidentally fired two live rounds after being told the gun did not have any ammunition. A crew member who was alarmed by the misfires told a unit production manager in a text message: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve now had 3 accidental discharges. This is super unsafe,‚Äù according to a copy of the message reviewed by the newspaper. The New York Times also reported that there were at least two earlier accidental gun discharges, citing three former crew members. Ms Mitchell, the script supervisor, told the Associated Press she was standing next to Ms Hutchins when the cinematographer was hit. ‚ÄúI ran out and called 911 and said ‚ÄòBring everybody, send everybody‚Äô, ‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis woman is gone at the beginning of her career. She was an extraordinary, rare, very rare woman.‚Äù Film-maker Mr Souza, who was shot in the shoulder, said in a statement to NBC News that he was grateful for the support he was receiving and ‚Äúgutted‚Äù by the loss of Ms Hutchins. ‚ÄúShe was kind, vibrant, incredibly talented, fought for every inch and always pushed me to be better,‚Äù he said. Santa Fe area district attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said prosecutors will be reviewing evidence in the shooting and do not know if charges will be filed. Crew workers At a vigil on Saturday, around 200 film crew workers gathered for a candlelight vigil as the sun set. They shared grief at the loss of one of their own, and fear of accidents on their own film sets. Several in attendance lit candles, held a moment of silence, read poetry and made brief comments including one testimonial to Ms Hutchins‚Äô artistic spark and generosity. ‚ÄúHer death shouldn‚Äôt have happened, Union sets should be safe sets,‚Äù said Liz Pecos, president of IATSE Local 480. Production on Rust was halted after the shooting. The crew member that spoke to the AP said he never witnessed any formal orientation about weapons used on set, which would normally take place before filming begins. He also said only minimal Covid-19 precautions were taken, even though crew and cast members often worked in small enclosed spaces on the ranch. The crew were initially housed at the Courtyard by Marriot in Santa Fe, according to the crew member. Four days in, however, they were told that they would be moved to the budget Coyote South hotel. Some crew members baulked at staying there. ‚ÄúWe packed our gear and left that morning,‚Äù the crew member said of Thursday‚Äôs walkout. ‚Äì PA",,10/24/21 8:33,"Hours before actor Alec Baldwin fired a fatal gunshot from a prop gun, a camera crew walked off the job in protest at conditions and production issues that included safety concerns.

Professors call for 'some kind' of COVID Plan B with emergency departments in 'terrible place',http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-professors-urge-some-kind-of-plan-b-and-warn-ministers-emergency-departments-are-in-a-terrible-place-12443176,,,,"Health leaders have urged the government to introduce ""some kind of Plan B"" with emergency departments in a ""terrible place"" amid rising levels of coronavirus infections.",,10/24/21 9:49,"Health leaders have urged the government to introduce ""some kind of Plan B"" with emergency departments in a ""terrible place"" amid rising levels of coronavirus infections. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, warned ministers that hospitals are ""already struggling to cope"" and that medical professionals are worried about the winter months ahead. Meanwhile, Professor Adam Finn, who is on the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told Sky News' Trevor Phillips on Sunday that COVID-19 hospital admissions and deaths are rising and the government must not be ""complacent"". Live COVID updates from the UK and around the world Prof Finn added that vaccines are not going to be enough to keep the spread of coronavirus under control and said people need to make an effort to avoid contact in order to slow transmission rates. Their comments come as the government faces increasing pressure to enact what is known as ""Plan B"", which includes working from home guidance and the mandatory use of face masks in some settings. Budget 2021: Rishi Sunak fails to commit to eastern HS2 leg days before autumn Budget is revealed in Commons COVID live: More than 325,000 people get booster jabs on record day in England COVID-19: Travel rules relaxed as cheaper lateral flow tests replace PCRs from today Health Secretary Sajid Javid said this week that new cases could reach 100,000 a day , but Downing Street insisted there was spare capacity in the NHS and that the fall-back Plan B would only be triggered if it came under ""significant pressure"". Mr Javid said the focus was on delivering the booster jab programme successfully. Earlier this week, it was announced that the former head of England's coronavirus vaccine delivery drive is returning to the NHS to lead the booster rollout, amid growing concerns about COVID-19's impact this winter. Scientific advisers have told the government preparations for Plan B restrictions should be made now so that measures ""can be ready for rapid deployment if required"" . Experts on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) also said, in minutes of a meeting published on Friday, that early intervention ""would reduce the need for more stringent, disruptive, and longer-lasting measures"". Speaking to Sky News' Trevor Phillips on Sunday, Dr Henderson said: ""Every bed that gets filled by a patient with COVID in a sense is in a hospital bed with a potentially avoidable disease. ""The problem is that things are worse at the moment so we need everybody to be as careful with the healthcare resources as they possibly can be, and try and minimise the need for healthcare resources."" Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker Dr Henderson continued: ""So if we can get COVID levels down, if we can make sure that the vulnerable don't get infected and then need hospital care, if we can make sure that we don't have people who are severely ill because they catch it when they're unvaccinated, all of that will help, we're all in this together to try and make it better."" Prof Finn called for ""a very different kind of message coming from the government now that there is a serious problem"". He told Sky News' Trevor Phillips on Sunday that he wants to ""avoid lockdowns"", but added that ""we can't avoid it if we all just go back to normal now"". On vaccines, Prof Finn said ""they're not by themselves going to be enough at the present time to keep the spread of the virus under control"", adding: ""We do need to see people continuing to make efforts to avoid contact, to avoid transmission, and to do other things as well as get vaccinated if we're going to stop this rise from going up further."" The warnings from health professionals came as Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves suggested the government should look at implementing Plan B. ""Labour as a responsible opposition have always said that we would follow the science, and we've seen today that SAGE are saying that some aspects of Plan B, like wearing masks on public transport and in shops, and also working from home more flexibly should be introduced,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""I think the first thing is, the government have got to do more to make Plan A work. If the scientists are saying work from home and masks, we should do that. So get A working better because the vaccination programme has been stalling, introduce those parts of Plan B."" Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said on Sunday that a return of the furlough scheme is ""not on the cards"", adding that the vaccine rollout is the ""best line of defence against having to move to put in place any restrictions"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said there are no plans for another lockdown and that ""vaccines are our way through this winter"". The latest data released on 23 October showed that the UK had recorded a further 180 COVID-related deaths and 49,298 in a 24-hour period.",https://e3.365dm.com/21/09/70x70/2372109170439895307_5515913.jpg?20210917170834,skynews

But they won't get the time of day if they went looking for the documentation they'd need.","News analysis (File photo by Paul Bersebach/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images)Somewhat controversially, children as young as 12 can arrange their own Covid-19 vaccinations.But that is almost purely theoretical it turns out.Those giving the shots say they'd be very loathe to do so without a parent present.And if the kid can't lay their hands on a birth certificate, the department of home affairs is not about to help.For more stories go to www.BusinessInsider.co.za.Children between 12 and 18 are now not only eligible to receive a single dose of a Covid-19 vaccine but can explicitly get themselves vaccinated with or without the consent of their parents.But after a week of teenage vaccinations, and discussions about what would happen in situations such as an objection by one parent, it is now clear that a child trying to arrange their own vaccination will, in practice, find it effectively impossible.Independent providers say they would be reluctant to provide a vaccination to an unaccompanied child, with the possibility that a vengeful anti-vaccine parent could then nit-pick about the process and procedure followed to test whether the child had properly consented. Nobody wants to be the test case who faces a damages claim or complaint before a professional body.But it turns out that is not the major hurdle children face. They are more likely to be unable to arrange a vaccine shot because the government won't help them do so.As with adults, children must be registered on the national¬†Electronic Vaccination Data System (EVDS) in order to receive a jab. To confirm their identity for the purposes of that system, they require ""South African ID cards, birth certificate with registration number, foreign passport or any verifiable asylum/refugee proof of identity bearing the name of the child"".¬†For the largest section of the eligible group, that will mean a birth certificate. And if the child can't lay their hands on a birth certificate presumably safely guarded by a parent or guardian?""There is no way you are going to have a child walk into the office and a [home affairs official] says 'I can help you with that ja"" one specialist provider of help obtaining government paperwork told Business Insider South Africa.It is not clear whether a child even has the theoretical right to obtain a copy of their own birth certificate. The department of home affairs refused to answer questions on the issue, instead referring all questions ‚Äì including on the mechanics of how it issues copies of birth certificates ‚Äì to the department of health.But those who deal with home affairs offices every day say that, much like nurses and doctors, an official who helps a child circumvent the wishes of a parent could get in trouble. Those who refuse to do anything at all face no repercussions.Get the best of our site¬†emailed to you every weekday.Go to¬†the Business Insider front page¬†for more stories.",10/24/21 10:09,,,businessinsider_za

"Parents more hesitant to vaccinate kids than themselves, researcher says",https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2021/10/24/parents-vaccinate-kids/,,['News Staff'],,"While many parents were overjoyed at the news that Health Canada is considering approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine for kids age five to 11 in Canada, some parents are feeling trepidatious.","Jennifer Hubert jumped at the opportunity to get her COVID-19 vaccine, but she‚Äôs not looking forward to having to make the decision about whether to vaccinate her three-year-old son Jackson. She recognizes the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, but said she also understands her son is at a much lower risk for serious illness than older adults. ‚ÄúTo me it‚Äôs not a clear benefit,‚Äù she said. While many parents were overjoyed at the news that Health Canada is considering approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine for kids age five to 11 in Canada, parents like Hubert are feeling more trepidatious, and public health officials said they are going to have a much more nuanced conversation with parents about vaccination than they did with adults. While 82 per cent of eligible Canadians aged 12 and up are already fully vaccinated, a recent survey by Angus Reid shows only 51 per cent of parents plan to immediately vaccinate their kids when a pediatric dose becomes available. Of parents with children in the five to 11 year age range, 23 per cent said they would never give their kids a COVID-19 vaccine, 18 per cent said they would wait, and nine per cent said they weren‚Äôt sure, according to the survey of 5,011 Canadians between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online surveys are not considered random samples. ‚ÄúMost of the research that I‚Äôve seen sort of indicates that parents are more hesitant to vaccinate their kids against COVID than themselves,‚Äù said Kate Allen, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Vaccine Preventable Diseases of the University of Toronto. There are several reasons parents might pause, she said. It‚Äôs true that children are at a much lower risk of serious outcomes associated with COVID-19, and there have been very rare incidents of mRNA vaccines like Pfizer or Moderna linked to cases of myocarditis, a swelling of the heart muscle. As of Oct. 1, Health Canada has documented 859 cases associated with the vaccines, which mainly seem to affect people under 40 years old, and people who‚Äôve developed the complication have typically been fine. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs rare, I know it‚Äôs not deadly, but I also see the risk of severe symptoms from COVID as being rare and not deadly for Jackson,‚Äù Hubert said when asked about weighing up the risks and benefits of the vaccine. But public health experts stress that some children do suffer from rare but serious impacts from COVID-19, which can also cause myocarditis as well as the little-understood impacts of the condition known as long COVID. They say parents should consider the less tangible benefits of vaccination as well. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs less of a conversation about a direct benefit to them, and more of a community benefit,‚Äù Allen said. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on children, depriving them of school, time with their peers, extracurriculars ‚Äî and their mental health has suffered as a result, said Dr. Vinita Dubey, associate medical officer of health with Toronto Public Health. ‚ÄúNot one child has been spared from this pandemic. I mean every single child has had to bear a sacrifice because of the pandemic in one way or the other,‚Äù Dubey said. So far Pfizer-BioNtech is the only manufacturer to request approval for its pediatric COVID-19 vaccine and Health Canada is still reviewing the data. The regulator has promised the review will be thorough, and the vaccine will only be approved for children if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Policy-makers know they‚Äôre going to have to take parents‚Äô concerns seriously as well. On a recent tour of the Childrens‚Äô Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with Dr. Anne Pham-Huy, a pediatric infectious diseases physician. ‚ÄúVaccine confidence is going to be the most important part of it this time around,‚Äù Pham-Huy said, to which Trudeau agreed. Dubey has published research on improving parents‚Äô vaccine confidence when it comes to long-established inoculations like mumps and rubella. While she offered several tips, they mainly come down to building trust. Her research focused on the role of family doctors, but she said during the pandemic anyone can be that trusted sounding board. ‚ÄúIt could be a faith leader, it could be an important family member or friend, someone who you trust, to help guide you to the right sources to make that decision,‚Äù she said. With that in mind, several students from across North America launched a peer-to-peer education program called Students for Herd Immunity to allow kids to have those conversations among themselves. The public health experts agree, the debate around vaccines has become polarized and open conversations will be the key to addressing parents‚Äô concerns. ‚ÄúI think one thing to say to parents is you don‚Äôt have to make your decision right away,‚Äù Dubey said. ‚ÄúI mean for those who are ready to make their decision, but it‚Äôs fine but if you have questions, seek the answers.‚Äù Her only advice is to get those answers from a trusted source, and not social media.",10/24/21 11:00,,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/9/2021/10/2021102217108-617328bc2c163479a3e2e07bjpeg.jpg,citynews1130

There were 473 people in hospital with the virus as of this morning, with 97 of those in intensive care (ICU). Paul Reid, chief executive of the HSE, has said it is encouraging to see more and more people come forward for Covid-19 vaccination, with 10,750 doses administered across the vaccination centres alone over the past four days. He said on Sunday that 5,000 of these were done through walk-ins and ‚Äúsignificantly from younger ages.‚Äù Mr Reid said there are over 2,000 people per day registering for a vaccine. Eilish Hardiman, chief executive of Children‚Äôs Health Ireland (CHI) which governs the children‚Äôs hospitals in Dublin, said it has been ‚Äúa very challenging fortnight‚Äù. ‚ÄúIn particular we‚Äôve seen a significant increase in the attendances to our emergency departments at Temple Street, Crumlin and Tallaght and our urgent centre at Connolly. ‚ÄúNormally we would see between 450 to 500 children a day. For example, last Monday we had 750 children attend our services,‚Äù Ms Hardiman told RT√â Radio‚Äôs News at One on Sunday. ‚ÄúThe reason for this is related to the annual flu virus event, known as RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), that affects children and babies and there are also obviously some other flus and viruses around.‚Äù Admitted Ms Hardiman said 50 babies and children have been admitted to the children‚Äôs hospitals requiring high flow oxygen to treat the RSV. She said normally children would be in for 24-48 hours with the RSV and other viruses but this year they are having to stay in for 4 to 5 days. ‚ÄúWe have more attending and they are staying in longer, which has meant hospital beds are at full capacity which means we have children waiting in trolleys in emergency departments,‚Äù she said. Ms Hardiman said there are 32 critical care beds available between Temple Street and Crumlin children‚Äôs hospitals. She said the hospitals were at ‚Äú100 per cent capacity‚Äù this week but that there were ICU beds available on Sunday as five patients had been discharged. Ms Hardiman also said there is ‚Äúsome surge capacity‚Äù within the hospitals which would be activated if there was an emergency. She said she would be supportive of staff getting a Covid-19 booster vaccine adding that some patient-facing staff had received their first dose last January. ‚ÄúWe are going to have a long hard winter and we do need to try and support our staff as much as possible,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBooster vaccine would be an important armory in trying to make sure we survive.‚Äù Meanwhile, the country needs to be ‚Äúon top of booster vaccines‚Äù and the programme should be ‚Äúeasy and quick‚Äù for people, Professor Jack Lambert, professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the Mater and UCD School of Medicine has said. Prof Lambert said nursing home residents, the immunocompromised and healthcare workers should all receive Covid-19 booster vaccinations. ‚ÄúWe need to be on top of booster vaccines and make it easy and make it quick and we‚Äôve done nothing easy and we‚Äôve done nothing quick in this country with any of the Covid strategies that we‚Äôve undertaken over the last 19 months,‚Äù he told RT√â Radio‚Äôs Brendan O‚ÄôConnor show on Sunday. Disease He said vaccination ‚Äúhelps tremendously‚Äù against the disease but that it is not eliminating Covid, adding ‚Äúwe‚Äôve known this for months‚Äù. Prof Lambert also said that it is important to keep schools open safely and that children shouldn‚Äôt wear masks in the classroom at primary level, but advised they should in certain situations such as using public transport, car pooling and going to the bathroom in school. He said he believed Covid-19 numbers will ‚Äúof course‚Äù rise over the coming weeks as further restrictions were loosened on Friday. ‚ÄúEven if Covid numbers do go up, lockdown is not a solution as far as I‚Äôm concerned,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHaving ICU beds that are under resourced in Ireland for the last 10 years, that‚Äôs not an excuse for lockdown.

Read Full Article at RT.com","Champagne sales are on the rise, surging back to numbers last seen before the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns sent sales plummeting, as people were banned from throwing parties. Champagne sales are on course to reach a four-year high this year, thanks to exports to the United States and Australia, French champagne wine growers lobby SGV said earlier this month. Sales between January and August soared 11.9%, even compared to the same period in pre-pandemic 2019. Also on rt.com Put a cork in it: France's Mo√´t backs down in bubbling row with Russia & agrees to brand its posh plonk as plain ‚Äòsparkling wine‚Äô At the time, French champagne houses shipped 297.6 million bottles globally. In 2020, however, the region exported only 244 million bottles, according to data from the Comit√© Champagne trade association. Turnover for the sector, which is France‚Äôs second-biggest export industry after aeronautics, showed a loss in profits of $980 million. ‚ÄúThe category was down almost 18% last year after declines of 2% in 2019,‚Äù an analyst from UK-based International Wines and Spirits Record (IWSR) told CNBC, citing the group‚Äôs Drinks Market Analysis figures. Now, based on the current increase, the firm expects champagne sales to grow about 4% this year, and continue the trend through 2025. The forecast of the French General Syndicate of Champagne Winegrowers is even more optimistic. The group expects that the current rally in global champagne markets may propel sales to 305 million bottles worldwide in 2021, a figure last seen in 2017.

Sales between January and August soared 11.9%, even compared to the same period in pre-pandemic 2019. At the time, French champagne houses shipped 297.6 million bottles globally. In 2020, however, the region exported only 244 million bottles, according to data from the Comit√© Champagne trade association. Turnover for the sector, which is France‚Äôs second-biggest export industry after aeronautics, showed a loss in profits of $980 million. ‚Äú The category was down almost 18% last year after declines of 2% in 2019, ‚Äù an analyst from UK-based International Wines and Spirits Record (IWSR) told CNBC, citing the group‚Äôs Drinks Market Analysis figures. Now, based on the current increase, the firm expects champagne sales to grow about 4% this year, and continue the trend through 2025. The forecast of the French General Syndicate of Champagne Winegrowers is even more optimistic. The group expects that the current rally in global champagne markets may propel sales to 305 million bottles worldwide in 2021, a figure last seen in 2017. Some experts believe that people are simply ready to party again after spending over a year locked down. ‚Äú If I have to guess, I think that consumers are ready to celebrate even just the little things in life ,‚Äù Natalie Pavlatos, a spokeswoman for US-based Champagne Bureau, told CNBC.

Christopher Lawrence ""Bong"" Go reassured that the government was working hard to accelerate the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines to halt the pandemic as his team conducted a relief effort for vulnerable residents of Makato and Numancia in Aklan on Monday, October 18. In a video message, Go explained that getting vaccinated substantially reduced one's risk of developing severe symptoms and being hospitalized. He reminded local authorities to follow the priority list to ensure the success of the national vaccination strategy. ""Habang patuloy tayong nagbabakuna, 'wag tayo maging kumpiyansa dahil delikado itong Covid-19. Target natin ma-achieve ang population protection this year at ang herd immunity by early next year para unti-unti na natin fully mabuksan ang ekonomiya. Iyan ang hiling namin palagi ni Pangulong Duterte (While we continue with our vaccinations, let us not be complacent because this Covid-19 is dangerous. We target to achieve the population protection this year and herd immunity by early next year in order that we could eventually fully open the economy. That is what President Duterte and I are always praying),"" the senator said. ""Ang importante, buhay tayo at malampasan natin ang pandemyang ito. Hindi ito kaya ng ating gobyerno kung hindi tayo magmalasakit at magbayanihan (What is important is that we are alive and that we overcome this pandemic. The government cannot accomplish these if we do not show compassion and community spirit),"" the senator added. Go's staff distributed meals, vitamins, face masks and face shields in batches to a total of 4,000 residents at the Aklan Sports Complex in the Makato and the Numancia covered courts. The staff gave select residents new shoes and bicycles for traveling as well as computer tablets for blended learning activities. Meanwhile, personnel from the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) provided each resident some financial assistance under its Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation program. The Department of Agriculture (DA) handed out separate financial assistance to farmers and fisherfolk under the Kadiwa ni Ani at Kita program. On the other hand, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority conducted assessments of residents, who were seeking livelihood and skills training opportunities. The senator, who was the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, also offered assistance to those who required treatment at the bigger hospitals in Metro Manila. He advised them to seek further aid from the government through the Malasakit Center, located at the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital in Kalibo, Aklan's capital. The Malasakit Center aimed to make medical assistance programs more accessible by putting together concerned agencies under one roof. These agencies were the DSWD, the Department of Health, the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. and the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office. The primary task of the Malasakit Center was to reduce a hospital bill to the lowest amount possible by covering various patient services and expenses, pursuant to the Malasakit Centers Act of 2019, which Go principally authored and sponsored in the Senate. The senator thanked Second District Rep. Teodorico Haresco Jr., Gov. Florencio Miraflores, Vice Gov. Reynaldo Quimpo, Makato Mayor Abencio Torres and Vice Mayor Ramon Legaspi 3rd, and Numancia Mayor Jeserel Templonuevo and Vice Mayor Rogelio Enero 2nd for working to help those hit hardest by the pandemic. As vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, Go has supported several initiatives to enhance accessibility and foster economic growth in Aklan. Among these initiatives were the construction of local roads in Makato and an evacuation center and a slaughterhouse in Numancia. Other major initiatives included the construction of roads in Balete; riverbank protection structures along the Tigayon-Kalibo and Minalezo sections of the Kalibo River; a multipurpose building for monitoring emerging and reemerging infectious diseases; a two-story building for the Ibajay District Hospital; multipurpose buildings in Balete and Buruanga; and the rehabilitation of the Altavas, Ibajay and Libacao public parks. Recently, Go's staff also provided relief to thousands of residents in Altavas, Balete, Banga, Batan, Kalibo, Lezo, Libaco, Madalag, Malinao and New Washington. The activities were carried out in batches to ensure the strict enforcement of health and safety protocols.",,10/24/21 12:56,,https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2021/10/24/22370.jpg,manilatimes

In a letter to state governments, the Centre said that the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine should be administered at the earliest. Uttar Pradesh has administered a total of 12.54 crore jabs, including 2.95 crore second doses. The state has an eligible population of 15.5 crore. Earlier, the UP government had conducted inoculation at the block level by creating mini clusters at the village level. A similar model, with some changes, is being implemented again this time around. Read | Covid-19: Centre asks states to ensure upcoming festivals celebrated with 'utmost precautions' Cluster Model 2.0 The state government has decided to divide all villages into three categories, which will determine the progress of the total vaccination. In this regard, the UP government sent a letter to all district magistrates on October 23 outlining the new strategy known as ""Cluster Model 2.0,"" which will be implemented beginning November 1. Uttar Pradesh leads the country with about 12.5 crore doses so far, and approximately 65 per cent of the eligible population in the state has received the first dose. However, the second dose coverage is less than 20 per cent, making it a priority concern. According to the letter accessed by India Today, all district magistrates must pay ""special attention"" to rural areas in order to meet the remaining target of the first dose. ‚ÄúThe Lekhpals will first validate the details of everyone who received the first dose, which will be an independent analysis that will provide reliable data,"" read the letter. Read | Delhi: Covid-19 protocols go for a toss as crowds throng markets, temples during festival season Villages to be divided into three groups Based on this, villages will be divided into three groups- those with more than 95 per cent coverage of the first dose of vaccination, those with 80-95 per cent coverage, and those with less than 80 per cent coverage. According to State Immunisation Officer Dr Ajay Ghai, immunisation work will be prioritised based on this list, with a focus on villages with more than 95 per cent vaccination coverage and villages with 80-95 per cent vaccination coverage for saturation. ‚ÄúThe vaccination will be prioritised based on these lists, and the task team will focus on increasing vaccination in the area where it is less than 80 per cent,‚Äù he said. Dr Ghai added, ‚ÄúThe villages saturated with the first dose will be defined as such and the village headman will also be honoured. The villages covered with both doses will be referred to as Covid secure villages.‚Äù In line with the previous model, this phase will also depend on ASHA and Anganwadi workers, as well as link workers who will visit villages to identify people who have been left out of the Covid-19 vaccination campaign so far. Meanwhile, the existing strategy of mass vaccination campaigns and flexi-timing in urban areas will continue. Read | India logs 15,906 new Covid cases, Kerala worst-hit state",,indiatoday

According to the newspaper, the official said that the increase in the number of cases is going to increase as the screening continues. The official also urged the public to take the booster shots of the COVID-19 vaccines to reduce the risks of the resurgence of the cases, reported Global Times.

Scientists to investigate activity of new ‚ÄòDelta Plus‚Äô variant in Ireland,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/scientists-to-investigate-activity-of-new-delta-plus-variant-in-ireland-1.4709423?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"Irish scientists will start investigating where and what ages the new ‚ÄúDelta Plus‚Äù Covid-19 variant is infecting and whether it is causing more severe illness, virologist Cillian De Gascun has said. The new mutated form of the Delta coronavirus variant ‚Äì categorised as a ‚Äúvariant under investigation‚Äù by the UK health authorities ‚Äì has been detected in more than 80 cases, he said. The new AY.4.2 variant accounts for 6 per cent of Covid-19 cases in the UK but is said to be 10 to 15 per cent more transmissible than the Delta variant that is dominant in Ireland and Britain. There is no evidence yet to suggest that the variant causes greater illness in the people it infects or that it renders the Covid-19 vaccines ineffective but it may have increased case numbers in Britain. The UK Health Security Authority has said that early evidence suggests that the Delta subvariant may have increased the growth rate in the UK compared to the original Delta variant. It has not yet been defined as a ‚Äúvariant of concern‚Äù ‚Äì the highest risk category for variants. Dr De Gascun, director of UCD‚Äôs National Virus Reference Laboratory, said the new variant AY.4.2 was ‚Äúnot driving‚Äù the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the State given that it accounted for less than 2 per cent of the 4,000 cases checked in September. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important that we monitor these things because a more transmissible virus, if and when it becomes dominant, will lead to more cases, which obviously may impact on admissions to hospitals. It is something we need to monitor but it is natural that the virus would continue to evolve,‚Äù said Dr De Gascun, who is a member of the National Public Health Emergency Team. He said that the UK evidence appears to show that the subvariant has ‚Äúa modestly increased growth rate‚Äù but this was based on ‚Äúreasonably small numbers‚Äù of the variant relative to the 50,000 new coronavirus cases being reported every day in Britain. ‚ÄúIt is still a minority variant in the UK. It is certainly a minority variant here. Will it become dominant? By sheer weight of numbers, if it is more transmissible and if transmission continues to occur, then it will and it‚Äôs just a question of how long that will take,‚Äù said Dr De Gascun. The variant did not seem to be increasing transmissibility to the same extent as the Alpha variant, first detected in the UK, did last year or the Delta variant, first found in India, he said. The Alpha variant that caused Ireland‚Äôs third wave last January and February, the most severe of the pandemic, was about 50 per cent more transmissible than the original virus that spread from Wuhan in China, while the Delta variant was about 60 per cent more transmissible than that. Dr De Gascun said scientists would look at where the Delta Plus cases are geographically and the age groups affected along with the disease severity to understand the variant better. ‚ÄúIt is similar to what they will do in the UK but with much smaller numbers overall so it will take longer to reach our conclusions because of the small number of cases we have,‚Äù he said.",,10/24/21 15:11,"Irish scientists will start investigating where and what ages the new ‚ÄúDelta Plus‚Äù Covid-19 variant is infecting and whether it is causing more severe illness, virologist Cillian De Gascun has said.

The Blackhawks announced Sunday morning that forward Ryan Carpenter and defenseman Erik Gustafsson had been removed from COVID-19 protocol. But there was no word on Kane. All three players missed practice Saturday after entering the protocol. The announcement doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that Kane or any of the players tested positive. They could have been deemed a close contact of someone who tested positive. General manager Stan Bowman said during training camp that the team was 100% vaccinated. The struggling Blackhawks are off to a 0-4-1 start. Kane leads the team with four assists and five points. ___ More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports The Associated Press,https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2021/10/20211021231028-617230a8f1540191c4081ddejpeg.jpg;w=630,nsnews

The CDC is also permitting mix-and-match booster doses -- allowing people to get a different booster brand than was used for a primary vaccination.

That's it,"" Niks told Agence France-Presse (AFP).Industry collapseDraconian travel curbs imposed to fight the coronavirus have battered the economy in Thailand, where tourism accounted for nearly 20 percent of national income pre-pandemic.Visitor numbers have collapsed from nearly 40 million a year to a trickle, leaving the hospitality industry struggling to survive.Thanakorn Kuptajit, the head of the Thai Alcohol Beverage Business Association, told local media he expects a 50 percent drop in the value of the $9 billion sector as a result of the ban.Denied government support and forbidden to serve drinks in-house, bars and pubs are also banned from selling alcohol online.As a result, some landlords in Bangkok have resorted to flouting the ban, serving booze discreetly in plain coffee mugs or soft drink cans.But for those who have played by the rules, it has been a tough year.In the upmarket expat hotspot of Thonglor, the co-owner of WTF Gallery Cafe, Chris Wise, says his business has been boarded up since April.A handyman, two bar staff and an assistant have lost work or been at reduced pay.WTF, which marked its 10th birthday earlier this year, is gearing up to reopen this week (October 21) with the launch of a new Thai art exhibition and tapas menu.Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha gave the industry some hope last week, announcing that as part of reopening the kingdom to tourism, the government plans to lift the alcohol ban in December.Bitter tasteBut Wise warned that with customer numbers reduced and less disposable income, the road to recovery will be long.""I can't imagine it going back to what it was like pre-Covid,"" he told AFP.""The sanook (enjoy), mai pen rai (no worries), sa bai dee (relaxed) life that Thais have is not coming back for a long time.""And the relaxation will be too little too late for many businesses, Teens owner Niks said.""It's a disaster. We have lost craftmanship, we lost industry manpower. We lost good bars, good restaurants because of mismanagement from the government,"" he said, adding his best bartenders are now working in other industries.Now as the clock ticks down to the reopening, customers at Teens sample the experimental kratom drinks menu.One sips a mango and lime concoction served in a cup made of beeswax with honey foam ‚Äî the slightly bitter tang of the kratom balanced out by the fruity sweetness.Down the bar, Pord, 40, tries his first kratom drink, the ""Tiger Ear"", which features garlic brine lime and soda.""It tastes like a sour plum.

Deal on Biden's $2T-plan edges closer,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/10/25/news/world/deal-on-bidens-2t-plan-edges-closer/1819592,['News'],['Associated Press'],,"WASHINGTON, D:C:: A deal within reach, President Joe Biden and Congress' top Democrats edged close to sealing their giant domestic legislation, though the informal deadline appeared to slip as they worked to scale back the measure and determine how to pay for it.Negotiations were expected to continue into the weekend, all sides indicating just a few issues remained unsettled in the sweeping package of social services and climate change strategies.Biden met at the White House on Friday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer joined by video call from New York, trying to shore up details. The leaders have been working with party moderates and progressives to shrink the once-$3.5-trillion, 10-year package to around $2 trillion in child care, health care and clean energy programs.Pelosi said a deal was ""very possible."" She told reporters back at the Capitol that more than 90 percent of the package was agreed to: The climate change components of the bill ""are resolved,"" but outstanding questions remained on health care provisions.Vice President Kamala Harris sounded even more certain. On a visit to New York City, she said tensions often rise over final details but ""I am confident, frankly ‚Äî not only optimistic, but I am confident that we will reach a deal."" No agreement was announced by Friday's self-imposed deadline to at least agree on a basic outline. Biden wants a deal before he leaves next week for global summits in Europe.Pelosi hoped the House could start voting as soon as next week, but no schedule was set.Sticking points appear to include proposed corporate tax hikes to help finance the plan and an effort to lower prescription drug costs that has raised concerns from the pharmaceutical industry. Democrats are in search of a broad compromise between the party's progressives and moderates on the measure's price tag, revenue sources and basic components.At the White House, the president has ""rolled up his sleeves and is deep in the details of spreadsheets and numbers,"" press secretary Jen Psaki said.Biden was to spend the weekend at his home in Wilmington, Delaware.Psaki compared the work to starting Social Security and other major federal programs decades ago, then building on them in following years.""Progress here is a historic package that will put in place systems and programs that have never existed in our society before,"" she said, noting the effort to expand child care and provide free prekindergarten for all youngsters.Negotiations are proceeding as Biden more forcefully appeals to the American public, including in a televised town hall, for what he says are the middle-class values at the heart of his proposal.In a Senate that is evenly divided between the Democrats and firmly opposed Republicans, Biden can't afford to lose a single vote. He is navigating his own party's factions ‚Äî progressives, who want major investments in social services and centrists, who prefer to see the overall price tag go down.""When you're president of the United States, you have 50 Democrats ‚Äî every one is a president. Every single one. So you gotta work things out,"" he said during a CNN town hall on Thursday.Still, he expressed optimism about the process. ""It's all about compromise. Compromise has become a dirty word, but bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible,"" he said.On one issue ‚Äî the taxes to pay for the package ‚Äî the White House idea seemed to be making headway with a new strategy of abandoning plans for reversing Trump-era tax cuts in favor of an approach that would involve imposing a 15-percent corporate minimum tax and also taxing the investment incomes of billionaires to help finance the deal.Biden has faced resistance from key holdouts, in particular Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, Democrat-Arizona, who has not been on board with her party's plan to undo former president Donald Trump's tax breaks for big corporations and individuals earning more than $400,000 a year.The president was unusually forthcoming Thursday night about the sticking points in the negotiations with Sinema and another Democrat, conservative Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia.While the president said Sinema opposed raising ""a single penny in taxes"" on the wealthy or corporations, a White House official later clarified that the president was referring to raising the top tax rates, not the range of tax proposals, ""which Sen[ator] Sinema supports."" If so, that could unlock a key piece of a deal. With a better understanding of the revenues available, Democrats can then develop a topline amount of spending for the package and adjust the duration and sums for various programs accordingly.Biden said Manchin doesn't want to ""rush"" the transition to clean energy so quickly it will result in major job losses in his coal-producing state.Even still, Biden acknowledged major reductions to his original vision.He signaled the final plan would no longer provide free community college, but said he hoped to increase Pell Grants to compensate for the loss of the policy.He also said that what had been envisioned as a federally paid, months-long family leave program would be just four weeks.Another work in progress ‚Äî the idea of expanding Medicare to include dental, vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors, is a priority for Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent of Vermont.Biden said he likes the idea, but with Manchin and Sinema objecting, the proposal is ""a reach."" Instead, Democrats, he said, are considering offering seniors an $800 voucher to access dental care as well as another program for hearing aids that Sinema may support. However, the vision care component, Biden said, has been harder to resolve and there is no consensus yet.Overall, Biden and his party are trying to shore up middle-class households, tackle climate change and have the most wealthy Americans and corporations pay what he calls their ""fair share"" for the nation.In the mix are at least $500 billion in clean energy tax credits and other efforts to battle climate change, $350 billion for child care subsidies and free prekindergarten, an extension of the $300-monthly child tax credit put in place during the Covid-19 crisis and money for health care provided through the Affordable Care Act.The newly proposed tax provisions, though, have rankled Democrats who have long campaigned on scrapping the Republican-backed tax cuts that many believe unduly reward the wealthy and cost the government untold sums in lost revenue at a time of gaping income inequality. Many are furious that perhaps a lone senator could stymie that goal.Under the changes being floated the 21-percent corporate rate would not change, nor would the top individual rate of 39.6 percent on those earning $400,000 or $450,000 for couples.However, the White House is reviving the idea of a corporate minimum tax rate that would hit even companies that say they had no taxable income ‚Äî a frequent target of Biden, who complains they pay ""zero"" in taxes.The new tax on the wealthiest individuals would be modeled on legislation from Sen. Ron Wyden, Democrat-Oregon, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. He has proposed taxing stock gains of people with more than $1 billion in assets ‚Äî fewer than 1,000 Americans.",,10/24/21 16:03,,https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2021/10/24/22339.jpg,manilatimes

The labor force participation rate, which measures the US economy's active workforce, was 61.6 percent in September, compared to 63.3 percent before the pandemic.The causes of the short staffing are myriad, from continued fears of contracting Covid-19, particularly among people who live with elderly family or children, to early retirements and objections over work-life balance and low wages.And while the government throughout the pandemic offered generous unemployment benefits to keep people who lost their job financially sound, their expiration last month hasn't yet caused hiring to increase.'Absolute war'The employee shortages come as restaurants and entertainment venues reopen amid as more Americans get vaccinated, and ahead of the uptick in business around the holiday season.With ""so many employers trying to hire so many people at the same time, it creates that imbalance,"" said Aaron Sojourner, an economist at the University of Minnesota.Employers who spoke to Agence France-Presse (AFP) told of mad scrambles to attract applicants by offering higher wages and other perks.Chekijian has put out ads looking for employees and attended job fairs with offers of time off, benefits packages and salaries as generous as he can manage, but still can't find the people he needs.""It's been shockingly slow,"" he said. ""It's definitely affecting what we're trying to do in terms of growing our business.""The biggest American retailers are hiring staff ahead of the holiday season, with Amazon and Walmart both recruiting 150,000 people, Target and UPS taking on 100,000 and FedEx 90,000.Logistics company GXO is looking to hire 9,000 employees for the busy season over the next two months, and its head of human resources Maryclaire Hammond said ""finding people has been a huge issue.""""There is a massive competition for talent at all levels, there is an absolute war,"" she said in an interview.Robots and burritosGXO is particularly short on material handlers and forklift operators, and has paid for billboards and social media advertisements and organized job fairs to attract applications.It has upped its pay by $3 to $5 per-hour in the past eight months and offered hiring incentives and a benefits package including health insurance, retirement contributions and college tuition assistance.But Hammond said getting people to stay is even trickier.""The current workforce is pretty fickle, happy to change,"" she said. If a warehouse nearby pays even slightly more, employees will move there.The company has tried to make workers feel comfortable, even going so far as to hand out burritos at some warehouses.""Offering very good burritos in the mornings, it sounds silly, but things like that really motivate people,"" Hammond said.It has also tried to find ways around the worker shortages by increasing automation in its warehouses by 40 percent this year.Staci Weinsheimer is looking for a full-time administrative job and feels that the market is finally turning in her favor.""I'm getting a lot of interviews, I'm getting a lot of great feedback from the employers,"" she said after meeting with hospitality companies at a job fair in Melville, New York.Some job seekers still struggle to find work, or question whether companies will treat them well.""Employers could be spending more money to attract new hires, and to improve working conditions. Those who do that find it easier to hire,"" Sojourner, the University of Minnesota economist, said.He added: ""But a lot of employers are reluctant to really raise wages, because that does come out of their profits, and then the incumbent employees might also want a raise.""",,10/24/21 16:03,,https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2021/10/24/22360.jpg,manilatimes
Taxing the super rich,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/10/25/business/top-business/taxing-the-super-rich/1819612,['Business'],['Jenny Say-Ng'],,"Will the newly filed House Bill 10253 or the proposed Super Rich Tax Act follow the various tax reforms introduced by the Duterte administration and become law? The bill aims to levy an annual tax starting January 1, 2022 on citizens (residents and nonresidents alike) and resident aliens at the rate of 1 percent on wealth above P1 billion, 2 percent on wealth above P2 billion, and 3 percent on wealth above P3 billion.Around P236.7 billion is expected to be raised annually from the 50 richest Filipinos alone, to be used to help the government pursue anti-poverty measures and other social programs aimed at closing the widening divide between the rich and the poor, according to the bill's explanatory note. Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III's initial comment was that the wealth tax would drive capital out of the Philippines. How justified is this?The wealth tax is not new. In 2018, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published a tax policy study focusing on wealth taxes. It showed that 12 OECD countries that used to have wealth taxes repealed these in the 1990s and 2000s and that the number of OECD countries that continued to impose wealth taxes had dwindled to just four by 2017. Based on the OECD study, many factors have been put forward to justify the repeal of net wealth taxes, one of which is the risk of capital flight, specifically due to increased capital mobility and access to tax havens. Hence, Dominguez's concern on the proposed super rich tax may be valid.Another factor that contributed to the repeal of wealth taxes ‚Äî one that may apply to the Philippines ‚Äî is the high cost of tax administration compared to limited revenues. In the Super Rich Tax bill, the net value of all taxable assets is defined as the market value of assets owned by a taxpayer, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated, reduced by debts owed by the taxpayer. While the definition may be simple, assessing the market value of all assets will be a very difficult exercise.While the market value of real properties, traded stocks, and other similarly traded assets may be easily obtained, hard-to-value assets such as intangibles, artwork, and the like may be harder to assess. In effect, it will take a chunk of the resources on the part of the tax office and the individual to ascertain the correct valuation ‚Äî and this needs to be done on an annual basis. It is a considerable challenge in terms of tax administration and enforcing compliance.Further, taking into consideration the computation of net taxable assets wherein debts are allowable deductions, the OECD study mentioned that the wealth tax provides incentives for borrowing to lower the tax base and thus can encourage tax avoidance and, in effect, lower the revenue that should have been collected from the wealth tax.Let us look at some of the merits of imposing a wealth tax following the OECD study:First, the wealth tax aims to address wealth inequality and will help promote equality of opportunity following the foremost point in the OECD study. Although the Philippines levies taxes on passive and active income, considering that the ultra-rich already have a high value of accumulated wealth to begin with, the after-tax earnings (also substantial as these are proportionate to the capital/investment) they receive will only be added to their total wealth, thereby increasing their wealth over time.This is pointed out in the proposed bill. Based on the 2021 Forbes list of the Philippines' 50 richest, these folks grew their wealth by 30 percent to P4 trillion despite the Covid-19 pandemic. This is against a backdrop of 29 percent of Filipinos, or over six million families, living on a monthly income of P10,000 or less for two decades, with salaries and worker wages nationwide slightly increasing only to adjust for inflation. This gaping divide has resulted in 50 Filipinos owning more wealth than the poorest 71 million Filipinos combined.The second argument supporting the wealth tax, according to the OECD study, is that wealth provides benefits above and beyond income. Wealth may bestow social status, power, greater opportunities, satisfaction or provide an insurance value against unexpected future needs and it has been argued that such benefits should be taxed (Meade, 1978). This holds true in the Philippines where it is the wealthy that usually wield the power and have access to better opportunities.With government debt sitting at P11.64 trillion as of August 2021 and the Covid-19 pandemic still an ongoing battle, legislators are looking for ways to generate more taxes. This is seen in the various tax measures being proposed, including the Super Rich Tax bill. In deliberating the proposed measure, Congress will no doubt look at the pros and cons of levying a wealth tax. Let us hope our legislators are able to establish additional provisions as necessary for this proposal to be an effective tax-generating measure.The author is a senior manager with the Tax and Corporate Services Division of Navarro Amper & Co., a member of the Deloitte Asia Pacific Network.

Centers for Disease Control Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky remains coy on whether the Biden administration would support COVID-19 vaccine mandates for essential workers or students . President Biden signed an executive order on Sept. 9 that required federal employees to receive a vaccine. Some cities have enacted similar policies despite immense resistance from the very workers the policies intended to protect. VACCINE MANDATES CREATE CONFLICT WITH DEFIANT WORKERS Walensky refused to be drawn on direct comments regarding support for further vaccine mandates - particularly, one for essential workers. Instead, she focused on the need for vaccines and the ways in which the administration would encourage workers to get the vaccine. ""The most disruptive thing you can do to a workforce is to have a Covid outbreak in that workforce,"" Walensky told "" Fox News Sunday "" host Chris Wallace. ""That will most definitely not only send people home but it will send people to the hospital and some may pass."" Walensky said that the administration has ""a plan"" to encourage vaccinations and would point the more hesitant essential workers towards ""education and counseling to get people the information they need."" She cited numbers that showed that more police officers over the past year have died from COVID-19 than from all other causes of death combined. OBAMA: ‚ÄòI UNDERSTAND‚Äô WHY AMERICANS WANT TO KNOW WHEN COVID-19 MANDATES WILL END' Police have remained a particularly resistant group. Major cities including Chicago and Los Angeles have enacted mandates for the police force, with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio weighing his own possible mandate. A New York City police union has threatened legal action over a possible mandate, even though 70% of officers have already been vaccinated. Walensky also avoided a question on whether the administration would support a vaccine mandate for school-aged children. She discussed the need to get authorization and approval before discussing any mandates. NSBA's ‚ÄòDOMESTIC TERRORISM‚Äô APOLOGY FALLS FLAT: ‚ÄòTHESE ARE PARENTS, NOT TERRORISTS,‚Äô DR. SAPHIER SAYS ""Right now we are at authorization, we're having discussions about authorization, so I think we need to get children vaccinated through this authorization and get to approval before we can make a judgment there,"" Walensky said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Oct. 1 signed a vaccine requirement for eligible school children to attend in-person lessons. The mandate, which does provide medical and personal belief exemptions, has prompted protests from some parents who suggest pulling their children out of school.

In fact, the current environment makes these challenges even more difficult. Employers need to deliver a sound employee value proposition supported by comprehensive total rewards programs. Beyond competitive salaries, which are table stakes at the moment, companies also need to focus their spend on a diverse set of benefits, wellbeing, and upskilling programs to drive employee engagement,"" Querubin said.Results also showed that around half of the companies (51 percent) surveyed located in the Philippines expect their business performance to be on target, with 43.8 percent expecting to be ahead of target this year.Job creation related to sales, information technology, and engineering could also be expected in the next 12 months, as 25.8 percent of companies are looking at hiring more workers. However, the majority of companies, at 65.3 percent, reported that they are looking at maintaining their headcount, as 8.9 percent of them said that they could reduce their workforce due to the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their businesses.""Companies are between a rock and a hard place when it comes to compensation planning. Employers need to continue effectively managing fixed costs as they rebound from the pandemic. On the other hand, companies recognize they need to boost compensation, especially in sectors where there may be a manpower crunch. This situation has driven organizations to explore alternative options to fixed pay increases, including sign-on, retention bonuses, functional and skill premiums, mid-year adjustments or pay increases,"" said Querubin.",,10/24/21 16:11,,https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2021/10/24/22410.jpg,manilatimes

Ang reproduction rate sa buong bansa ay nasa 0.52 na at ang seven-day average sa bansa ay 5,400.

Last week, it was at 8,400 and dropped to 5,400 within a week, which was a 35 percent decrease or negative growth rate),"" he said.David said the decline could be attributed to the vaccination campaign since those getting infected were people without jabs, or were vaccinated but with comorbidities or those whose bodies cannot reproduce as many antibodies to fight the virus.""Isa sa madaling paliwanag sa madaling pagbaba ng kaso ay ang pagbabakuna dahil medyo marami na tayong nabakunahan. Aside from that, mayroon ding may mga dala na ng antibodies dahil previously infected na sila (one explanation is the high rate of vaccination because many have been inoculated. Aside from that, there are those who are carriers of antibodies after they have been previously infected by Covid-19),"" he explained.In Metro Manila, the reproduction rate is now 0.47, and the seven-day daily average is down to 967 cases from 1,639 the previous week.Cases in Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon) and Central Luzon are also on a decline, David said.The caseloads are still high in Zamboanga City and Zamboanga del Norte, Isabela, Cagayan,and Negros Oriental.In an earlier statement, OCTA reported that Covid-19 cases might have peaked last September 11 at more than 26,000 cases. Within that week, daily cases averaged at around 20,000 to 21,000.Around mid-September, the reproduction rate nationwide was 1.2, but later waned to 0.99 with an average of 4,674 new cases per day. In the following weeks, the reproduction rate continued to decline, David said.The ideal reproduction rate is 1 one or less, which translates to little to no community transmission.David also expects less than 5,000 cases in the coming week. If the trend continues, he sees 3,000 cases by November, and only 1,000 to 2,000 cases by December.David advised the public to keep observing health and safety protocols despite the improving situation, to speed up the recovery of the economy.On Sunday, the Philippines logged 5,279 new cases, pushing the total to 2,756,923.Of the 60,957 active cases, 83.6 percent were either mild or asymptomatic.Nationwide hospital utilization decreased to 53 percent for intensive care unit (ICU) beds, 41 percent for isolation beds, and 38 percent for ward beds.Similarly, bed utilization in the National Capital Region declined to 46 percent for ICU beds, 35 percent for isolation beds, and 34 percent for ward beds.",,10/24/21 16:12,,https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2021/10/24/22411.jpg,manilatimes

Milan takes top spot in Serie A,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/10/25/sports/milan-takes-top-spot-in-serie-a/1819601,['Sports'],['Agence France-Presse'],,"MILAN: AC Milan moved top of Serie A on Saturday (Sunday in Manila) after winning 4-2 at nine-man Bologna after having thrown away a two-goal half-time lead with the hosts already down to 10.Ismael Bennacer put Milan ahead for the second time six minutes from the end before Zlatan Ibrahimovic sealed a hard-fought win against a Bologna team which had Adama Soumaoro and Roberto Soriano both sent off in the first hour.Stefano Pioli's unbeaten Milan are a point ahead of Napoli, who travel to Roma on Sunday hoping to maintain their 100 percent record so far this season, but was not happy with their display.It comes after a painful Champions League defeat to Porto midweek and with a raft of first-choice players out injured or with Covid-19.""We thought we had won the game because we were two ahead and had a man extra, but if you stop playing you take a risk,"" Pioli told Sky Sport Italia.""It's a big win. We know that when you have European commitments and you play someone who has had all week to prepare it's going to be a difficult match.""Sinisa Mihajlovic's Bologna meanwhile are ninth on 12 points after a defeat which will frustrate their Serb coach after they battled back to level shortly after the break.""With nine men, 10 men and even with 11 we were better than Milan today, they created little. It wasn't easy but we showed today that we're a good team,"" said Mihajlovic.""We lost the points but we've won when it comes to play, spirit, courage and all the things that make a good team.""Milan save blushesEverything seemed to be going Milan's way in the 16th minute when Rafael Leao collected Ibrahimovic's classy through ball and lashed home a shot via a huge deflection off Gary Medel.Soumaoro was then shown a straight red card for bringing down Rade Krunic as the Bosnian raced through onto Simon Kjaer's pass.By the time Davide Calabria lashed home the second in the 35th minute Milan looked home and dry, but Bologna came racing out of the traps after the break and were level within seven minutes of the restart.First Ibrahimovic weakly glanced home Nicolas Dominguez's inswinging corner under little pressure in the 49th minute, and then Musa Barrow slipped behind a stunned Milan defense to confidently finish from Soriano's pass.Soriano then left his team down to nine with more than half an hour left to play after planting his foot onto Fode Ballo-Toure's ankle as the Senegal international was crossing the ball.And Bennacer broke the home side's resistance with a stylish first-time finish as the ball dropped to him from high.Ibrahimovic then gave the scoreline a more flattering appearance when he collected from Bennacer and scored his second league goal of the season.Earlier, Empoli held off battling Salernitana to win an exciting Serie A contest 4-2 after racing to a four-goal lead at half-time, moving them up to 10th on 12 points.Sassuolo moved away from the relegation zone with a 3-1 win over promoted Venezia which takes them to 12th on 11 points.",,10/24/21 16:20,,https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2021/10/25/22423.jpg,manilatimes

Q&A: What you need to know about the return of nightclubs,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/q-a-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-return-of-nightclubs-1.4709499?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"Nightclubs and similar venues reopened on Friday night for the first time in 19 months. However, guidelines for this latest phase of reopening have only emerged in recent days, with some confusion over whether some venues require tickets and what other preventative measures are in place. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know on the return of nightclubs, entertainment and live music. Q. So, nightclubs have finally reopened? Yes. Nightclubs and most music venues are effectively able to operate at full capacity since last Friday, having either been closed or not able to do so since March 2020. Live music venues can have up to 1,500 people standing at events, in addition to full capacity in seated areas. Q. Do I need to book a ticket if I want to go to a nightclub? From next week, yes. In something of a surprise development on Friday night, the Government decided that from next week all events in nightclubs must be fully ticketed. Tickets must be allocated in advance of events taking place. Q. Why are tickets required and how far in advance will they have to be purchased? Ticketing is required for the purposes of contact tracing and, according to a spokeswoman for the Department of Arts and Culture, to avoid ‚Äúmassed congregation outside venues from walk-up customers‚Äù. It was stressed that tickets for nightclubs could be purchased right up to until the doors opened and could also be purchased online. Q. What about pubs? Will I need a ticket if there is live music happening in a pub? Pubs with live music will not automatically be subject to the new rules in relation to ticketing, it was confirmed on Sunday. A spokesman for Minister for Culture Catherine Martin said that tickets will only be required for venues specifically operating for the purposes of live entertainment or nightclubs. However, it is also understood that if a pub wants to allow dancing in the way that nightclubs or live venues do, they will need the relevant licences and they will have to be ticketed. Where there is live music but no dancing, no tickets will be needed. Q. This all seems a bit confusing, will there be any more clarity on the new guidelines? The Department of Enterprise and the Department of Tourism, Arts and Culture will meet on Tuesday morning to work through issues which have emerged in relation to the guidelines, and new regulations will be published during the week. Q. What is the view of the industry on the requirement for tickets? The Licensed Vintners Association (LVA) has described the new rules as ‚Äúa disaster‚Äù for late bars, nightclubs and musicians. The Vintners‚Äô Federation of Ireland (VFI) has said the requirements would lead to confusion among both staff and customers and would be impossible to implement, while concerns have been cited in relation to measures requiring tickets to be given to patrons ‚Äúin advance‚Äù of an event. Q. Do I need to be vaccinated to attend a nightclub/live music event? A digital Covid-19 pass and photographic ID is required for indoor hospitality and events. Taoiseach Miche√°l Martin has said hospitality businesses need to strictly follow requirements to ask customers for vaccination certificates. Q. What about face masks ‚Äì do they have to be worn in a nightclub? People are asked to wear masks when they are not eating, drinking or dancing. Queuing for drinks at bars and counters is allowed but beverages must be consumed elsewhere on the premises. Q. What time can venues stay open until? Nightclubs are allowed to remain open late depending on the licence of the individual premises. The 11.30pm curfew for pubs has also been scrapped. Q. Are there any other restrictions for restaurants/pubs? Such hospitality settings can have multiple table bookings with a maximum of 10 adults per table, as well as five people aged under 18. People can queue at the bar, but they must be socially distanced and must then return to their table. Q. Do we have any idea when all remaining Covid-19 restrictions will be lifted? The latest recommendations from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) to Ministers said restrictions such as mask wearing and social distancing must remain in place until February 2022. Speaking earlier this week, T√°naiste Leo Varadkar said: ‚ÄúThe pandemic isn‚Äôt over yet.

Florida Gov. DeSantis: Vaccine mandates 'will wreak havoc on the economy',https://www.foxnews.com/media/florida-gov-desantis-vaccine-mandates-will-wreak-havoc-on-the-economy,,['Talia Kaplan'],,Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis argued that COVID-19 vaccine mandates will 'wreak havoc in the economy.',,10/24/21 16:34,"close Video Gov. DeSantis on vaccine mandates: Florida wants to 'protect all the jobs' Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis says his state is trying to recruit law enforcement who are 'not being treated well' from other states amid vaccine mandates. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis argued on Sunday that coronavirus vaccine mandates ""will wreak havoc in the economy ."" The Republican slammed the vaccine mandates during an exclusive interview with "" Sunday Morning Futures. "" ""What Biden‚Äô s doing is unconstitutional. He does not have the authority to do this,"" DeSantis told host Maria Bartiromo . He then explained what the vaccine mandates will do on a ""practical level."" ""In addition to be taking away people‚Äôs personal choices, it will wreak havoc in the economy because even if a small percentage of these folks end up losing their jobs or voluntarily walking away, you‚Äôre going to have huge disruptions in medical, in logistics, in law enforcement ,"" DeSantis said. ""So in Florida our policy‚Äôs very clear,"" he continued, ""we‚Äôre going to have a special session and we‚Äôre going to say nobody should lose their job based off these injections."" A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to Fox News‚Äô request for comment. DeSantis stressed that getting the vaccine is ""a choice you can make, but we want to make sure we‚Äôre protecting your jobs and your livelihoods."" DeSantis made the comments three days after he tweeted out an updated version of the Florida state flag that was trending on social media after calling for the special session to ban local coronavirus vaccine mandates. FLORIDA FINES COUNTY $3.5M FOR VIOLATING VACCINE MANDATE BAN ""Don‚Äôt tread on Florida,"" the flag reads with an alligator on the bottom paying tribute to the Gadsden flag that contains the message ""Don‚Äôt Tread On Me."" On Thursday, DeSantis called on the Florida legislature to hold a special session with the aim of banning vaccine mandates in his state. The Republican governor said he will convene a special session of the GOP-controlled statehouse in November to address vaccine requirements. He did not specify a starting date. ""At the end of the day, you shouldn‚Äôt be discriminated against based on your health decisions,"" he said during a news conference on Thursday. ""We want to provide protection for people, we want to make it clear that, in Florida, your right to earn a living is not contingent upon whatever choices you‚Äôre making in terms of these injections."" DeSantis outlined policy goals for the special session, including holding businesses liable for adverse reactions to vaccines, removing legal liability protections for employers with vaccine mandates, and added protections for people fired for not being vaccinated. PILOT REBUFFS BIDEN'S VAX MANDATE AMID SOUTHWEST TURMOIL: ‚ÄòWE HAVE ALL THE CONTROL‚Äô The Florida governor also told Bartiromo that his state is ""actively working to recruit out of state law enforcement"" who risk losing their jobs unless they get the vaccine. Last week the Chicago police union‚Äôs first vice president, Michael Mette , issued a blistering attack on Mayor Lori Lightfoot‚Äôs vaccine mandate. Mette‚Äôs remarks were aimed at a city policy requiring that all city employees, including police officers, enter their vaccine status in the city‚Äôs data portal. On Tuesday, Police Superintendent David Brown said 21 department employees had been placed on ""no-pay status"" for refusing to provide the information. He said the department needed to talk to hundreds of officers who had thus far not provided the information. Mette encouraged those officers to stay their ground and blasted city leaders for not meeting at the bargaining table. Video ""In Florida, not only are we going to want to protect the law enforcement and all the jobs, we‚Äôre actually actively working to recruit out of state law enforcement because we do have needs in our police and our sheriffs‚Äô departments,"" DeSantis told Bartiromo. ""So in the next legislative session, I‚Äôm going to hopefully sign legislation that gives a $5,000 bonus to any out of state law enforcement that relocates in Florida,"" he said. On Sunday, DeSantis had a message for members of law enforcement: ""If you‚Äôre not being treated well, we‚Äôll treat you better here. You can fill important needs for us, and we‚Äôll compensate you as a result."" Earlier this month, DeSantis threatened to sue the Biden administration over the anticipated federal coronavirus vaccine mandate. Last month, the president announced businesses with more than 100 employees will be required to mandate COVID-19 vaccines or administer weekly tests. Employers are also required to pay employees for time off to get vaccinated and recover from side effects. The governor's comments came during a press conference in Fort Myers on monoclonal antibody treatments, which the governor has worked to make more accessible in the state to prevent severe COVID-19 infections. ""I think that the mandate is going to lose in court,"" DeSantis said during the press conference regarding the federal mandate. He added that Florida would contest any such mandate from the Biden administration ""immediately,"" and that any lawsuits from the state would be filed in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Video CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP DeSantis and Biden have taken opposite stances on both vaccine and mask mandates.

Gottlieb says kids could start getting COVID-19 vaccine as soon November 4-5,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scott-gottlieb-covid-vaccine-kids-face-the-nation-2021-10-24/,,,,Gottlieb said the Biden administration is making the effort to push the vaccine directly into pediatricians' offices.,,10/24/21 17:05,"Former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb predicted Sunday on ""Face the Nation"" that the Biden administration could begin rolling out COVID-19 vaccines for children as soon as November 4, right after panel of Centers for Disease Control panel will decide whether to grant emergency use authorization for the COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5-11. Gottlieb said the Biden administration is making the effort to push the vaccine directly into pediatricians' offices. Pfizer, which Gottlieb is on the board, is developing a small tray that carries 10 vials at a time and a storage container that is small enough for small-to-medium sized pediatrician's office to stock the vaccine and deliver it. Transcript: Dr. Scott Gottlieb on ""Face the Nation"", October 24, 2021 ""It could be stored in a regular refrigerator for up to 10 weeks. It was purposely packaged that way,"" Gottlieb said. ""And so, the idea is to try to get it into pediatrician's offices because we know that getting children vaccinated is a much more consultative endeavor."" Gottlieb said many parents may not want to drag their children into a mass vaccination site or pharmacy and would rather have their children in the comfort of their own pediatrician's office. Dr. Scott Gottlieb on ""Face the Nation"" on October 24, 2021. CBS News Pfizer and BioNTech asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine for children 5 to 11 in early October. On Friday, scientists at the FDA said that the likely benefits of giving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to 5- to 11-year-olds far outweigh the potential risks, such as heart inflammation. On Tuesday, the FDA's advisory panel will meet to review the data and evidence of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in children, and vote on whether the FDA should authorize the use. ""If Pfizer does get the authorization on Tuesday from FDA, even before the CDC votes on this on November 2 and 3, they'll start to ship it into the supply chain so it will be available for use once there is a hopefully positive vote from CDC, said Gottlieb. So, it could be as early as November 4 and 5 that you can go into some locations and get your child vaccinated,"" he said. Although kids are at a lower risk of having a severe outcome due to contracting the virus, many have been hospitalized. According to the CDC , at least 731 children have died from COVID-19, including 160 deaths in the 5- to 11-year-old age range.

GettyManchester United were completely embarrassed by Liverpool on Sunday[/caption] Getty - ContributorManchester City won 6-1 at Old Trafford a decade ago, but this was an even bigger humiliation[/caption] The 6-1 defeat at the hand of Manchester City will be sung about for ever in the blue half of this town. But there was something a lot, lot worse about this. More humiliating, more embarrassing, just downright pathetic. That City game was at least still alive in the 81st minute when Darren Fletcher pulled a goal back at 3-1. They could also point to Jonny Evans 47th minute red card as a turning point with City‚Äôs lead at just 1-0. It was five by the time Paul Pogba walked for a reckless challenge in this having just come on at the break. No for this there was no excuses. This is arguably the most disgraceful performance put on by a Manchester United team in this famous old stadium in living memory. The City defeat could be seen as a one off, after all United came back to take an eight point lead in the title race with six games to go, before that final Aguero moment tipped the scales at the end. The Spurs 6-1 defeat at the start of last season came after the Covid chaos had extended the previous season and left United with little pre-season. They would gather, and recover.

For this manager, for this team, for these fans. Many of the Red faithful streamed out when the third went in, by half-time it was 4-0 and the boos rang round the ground. They have never been louder, not in David Moyes, Louis van Gaal or Jose Mourinho‚Äôs time. To be fair under Van Gaal most fans were asleep so couldn‚Äôt boo. All around the ground the faithful were losing it, really losing it with this team and maybe now sadly with this manager. Paul Scholes had it spot on when he assessed Wednesday night‚Äôs drama against Atalanta. He was not wallowing in the glory of the comeback against the sixth best Italian side who had arrived with major injury problems. Instead he was worried, really worried about this game because what he had witnessed in the first half as Atalanta went 2-0 up had alarm bells ringing. He was so worried he wasn‚Äôt just biting his own nails. He knew that if they defended in this fixture like they did then in the first half of that Champions League game there would be no coming back. They were actually worse. Totally rudderless, disjointed. ReutersNINTCHDBPICT000688963160[/caption] The back four looked like they had all just met after winning a raffle to play for United. With the game at 2-0 there was a pause in play as James Milner got attention for an injury. Nobody in the United side took the chance to issue a rallying cry, to gee the troops up. Indeed the only conversation on the pitch was between Harry Maguire and Fred, no doubt about who would be getting the lowest score in the match ratings. They had all given up. Pathetic. In a game of this magnitude you don‚Äôt dare do that. Solskjaer goes on about how privileged these players should feel to wear the United shirt. Well on a sorry Sunday at Old Trafford they shamed it.",10/24/21 17:27,,,thesun

Sunak 'fighting in the fog' as he puts finishing touches to budget,http://news.sky.com/story/budget-2021-rishi-sunak-fighting-in-the-fog-as-he-sets-the-tenor-of-his-chancellorship-12443742,,,,When Rishi Sunak stands up to deliver his budget and three-year spending review on Wednesday it will be his first real opportunity to set the tenor of his chancellorship unencumbered from the immediate crisis of COVID - although the fall-out of this pandemic will undoubtedly loom large.,,10/24/21 17:45,"When Rishi Sunak stands up to deliver his budget and three-year spending review on Wednesday it will be his first real opportunity to set the tenor of his chancellorship unencumbered from the immediate crisis of COVID - although the fall-out of this pandemic will undoubtedly loom large. It will make a change for a chancellor who has spent his first 20 months in office embroiled in the biggest public health crisis seen in a century, which in turn triggered an economic crisis that has left the public debt - borrowing accumulated over time - at about 95% of GDP, the highest level in more than 50 years. Having guided the country through the past 18 months, spending hundreds of billions to prop up public services, people's pay packets, and businesses, the chancellor is now focused on the post-pandemic rebuild. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player On Wednesday, Mr Sunak will set out on that journey in his first-ever joint budget and Spending Review, in which he will set the 'spending envelope' - how much total government spending will be over the next three years - as he divides up funds between different departments. 'Highly unlikely' to see further tax rises A big set piece event, government ministers and economists are not expecting a big tax and spend budget, those decisions have already been taken: Prime Minister Boris Johnson has only just announced a manifesto-busting ¬£12bn hike in national insurance to fund the NHS and social care, while Mr Sunak lifted corporation tax and the freezing of personal allowances in the March budget. ""This is the third big fiscal event of the year. We've already had a budget and huge tax rises, so it's highly unlikely we'll see the raising of any taxes,"" said Paul Johnson of the Institute of Fiscal Studies. COVID-19: Record number of coronavirus booster jabs administered - with 800,000 given in past 72 hours Budget 2021: Rishi Sunak announces ¬£6bn investment to tackle NHS waiting lists and improve digital tech in hospitals COVID-19: Professors urge 'some kind of Plan B' and warn emergency departments are in 'terrible place' ""We don't expect to see a cut in spending, but a lot of departments will still have less to spend, not least because spending on the NHS keeps taking a big slice of pie."" Government insiders say all departments will see an increase in their day-to-day budgets in real terms, but eyes will be on how unprotected areas of government - the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office, local government - fare in terms of their spending settlements, given that more than 40% of spending overall is now funnelled into the NHS and social care. But if this is not to be a headline-grabbing budget, allies hope it will be the moment in which this war-footing chancellor finally gets to show his peacetime approach to the job is reforming and fiscally responsible. Mr Sunak cites Nigel Lawson - the Thatcher-era chancellor who reduced the top rate of income tax from 83% to 40% - as the predecessor from whom he draws inspiration. ""He doesn't want to be driven just by events,"" says one ally. ""He wants to be a reformer and come out of this crisis with fresh eyes about how the Treasury might do things better."" Business rate reform on the back-burner To that end, the chancellor is expected to announce a simplification of alcohol duties in this budget, halving the 15 different bands of duties to simplify taxes. It will be billed as totemic of Mr Sunak's desire to reform and simplify the tax system as well as a post-Brexit opportunity - the UK can do this because it's no longer bound by EU directives on alcohol taxation. What he won't do this time around however is reform business rates, delaying again the fundamental overhaul of the system promised in the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto and followed up by a review in Spring 2020. Allies say Mr Sunak does want to reform the system, and level up between bricks and mortar businesses and virtual ones - he is considering whether to introduce an online sales tax - but has decided to push business rates reforms into next year. One ally said the reality is that the chancellor hasn't had the time to do the work on what is a policy-dense and politically fiddly policy area. It will no doubt disappoint businesses, and the chancellor's ability to overhaul the system before the next election will become a test of how much of a reforming chancellor he really is. Mr Sunak will also use the budget to build on his conference speech as he stresses again the need for fiscal responsibility - his slogan for the speech will be along the lines of 'responsible choices for a stronger economy'. Reining in government borrowing The chancellor has set current spending plans around an ambition to stop borrowing to fund day-to-day spending within three years, and the expectation is that he could use the budget to set out formal rules to rein in government borrowing in order to demonstrate fiscal discipline ahead of the next election. But this budget is more than just an opportunity for Mr Sunak to signal he is both a reformer and fiscally disciplined, he will also use this moment to reiterate the prime minister's amorphous levelling-up agenda. England's city regions will receive ¬£7bn for transport improvements as the chancellor looks to improve services for those living in Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and South Yorkshire. Decisions on the future of the High Speed 2 rail line from London to northern England and an upgrade of the trans-Pennine line from Leeds to Manchester (dubbed HS3) will be made after the budget, when the Integrated Rail Plan is announced. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The chancellor is also expected to announce a standard annual rise for the minimum wage in the budget, pushing it closer to ¬£10, from ¬£8.91 an hour for over-23s (the National Living Wage). In 2019, the former chancellor Sajid Javid promised to lift the minimum wage to ¬£10.50 an hour for over-21s by 2024. COVID still looms large If you asked the chancellor what most worried him about the coming months, I suspect COVID would inevitably loom large. The risk of a new COVID variant could put the country, and the economy, back on its heels - and even if the gloomiest scenario doesn't come to pass, what is more certain is that this chancellor is living with uncertainty. Supply chain shortages, inflation, rising prices, and the possibility of rising interest rates: it is a fiendishly complicated and volatile landscape upon which to build a post-COVID recovery. While the prime minister told Sky News last month that fears over inflation have proved ""unfounded"", it is thought that the chancellor and other cabinet ministers are very worried about inflationary pressure and the knock-on effect it could have on the cost of living, interest rates and public finances, as a 1% interest rate rise increases government debt repayments by ¬£21bn a year - equivalent to the entire defence budget. ""It's unpredictable at the moment,"" says the IFS's Paul Johnson. ""The fiscal outlook is so dependent on what the OBR forecast the economy will be in three years time, but determining what he's got to spend because of fiscal rules, comes with huge uncertainty. Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker . ""Even ignoring COVID we don't really understand where the economy is at the moment. And in addition, we don't know whether COVID will peter out or cause more problems, so he is fighting in fog."" A chance then this week for the chancellor to set out the principles that will guide him. But the path ahead is still too hard to tread with any confidence.",https://e3.365dm.com/21/10/70x70/skynews-rishi-sunak-red-briefcase_5539779.jpg?20211008152233,skynews

Story continues below advertisement Infectious disease expert Dr. Brian Conway said a similar hesitancy existed when the polio vaccine was first introduced in the 1950s. ‚ÄúToday we don‚Äôt even question that it‚Äôs part of the vaccines that are given shortly after birth,‚Äù the medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not there with COVID yet.‚Äù 4:55 Focus BC Extra: the return to full capacity, but not for everyone Focus BC Extra: the return to full capacity, but not for everyone Like COVID-19, polio was spread through the air by people without symptoms talking, coughing or sneezing. The viral disease hit children under the age of five the hardest, invading the nervous system, causing paralysis and breathing problems. Many victims needed the help of an iron lung to keep breathing, while others had to use crutches or metal braces after suffering permanent nerve damage. Story continues below advertisement When Dr. Jonas Salk developed a polio vaccine in 1955, Conway said there was fierce resistance at first. ‚ÄúWhen new products including the poliomyelitis vaccine in the 1950s are rolled out, there is a proportion of the population that will be skeptical,‚Äù he said. Read more: A polio disaster helped shape vaccine safety. Here‚Äôs why that matters for the coronavirus At the time, the public had reason to question its efficacy. While the polio vaccine was safe, California-based Cutter Laboratories failed to manufacture it properly ‚Äî with deadly consequences. In April 1955, some batches of vaccine given to the public contained live polio virus, even though the CDC said they had passed required safety testing. Thousands of children were infected with polio, 200 were left paralyzed and 10 died. The CDC said the Cutter incident was a ‚Äúdefining moment in the history of vaccine manufacturing and government oversight,‚Äù and led to the creation of a better system for regulating vaccines. ‚ÄúTo explain to people that this was bad batch of vaccine, that on odds polio vaccination was much more effective than it was dangerous, slowly but surely convinced everyone to receive the vaccines,‚Äù Conway told Global News. Story continues below advertisement 2:21 British Columbians need second vaccine passport for air and rail travel British Columbians need second vaccine passport for air and rail travel Today, polio is an excellent example of how vaccines are the key to control and eventually eliminate various diseases, Conway said. Canada was certified as a polio free country in 1994, along with the rest of the Americas. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen a case of polio and I hope I never have to see one,‚Äù UBC Department of Family Medicine clinical assistant professor Dr. Birinder Narang told Global News. According to the BCCDC, the only polio cases in our province within the last thirty years were non-vaccinated residents who had contact with polio-infected foreign visitors. ‚ÄúThe success of the vaccines of the polio virus have actually led to the eradication of two of the three strains that were predominant in the world,‚Äù Narang said.

Chow described the virtual eradication of polio through vaccination as one of the greatest triumphs of modern medicine and public health. ‚ÄúMany people who decline to be vaccinated against COVID-19 are actually enjoying the benefits of vaccination themselves right now,‚Äù he added. That‚Äôs because they‚Äôve been previously vaccinated as children, he said, and because they benefit from the billions of people around the globe who are inoculated against different diseases ‚Äì including polio.

COVID-19 cases in Ottawa rose steadily in September 2020 and a similar trend was seen in 2021, but with a majority of the city vaccinated against COVID-19, the wave this fall was much less harsh than it was in 2020. Figures from Ottawa Public Health, available on Open Ottawa , show that active COVID-19 cases peaked at 1,501 on Oct. 3, 2020 before they started to decline again. By Oct. 23, the active case count had dropped to 1,367. Active COVID-19 cases in Ottawa 2020 vs 2021 Infogram In 2021, the peak during the most recent wave was 740 active cases on Sept. 18. Ottawa's caseload has since dropped to 242 active cases as of Sunday's most recent snapshot from OPH , a fraction of what it was on the same date in 2020. ""Oh man, the difference in the year has been incredible,"" said Ottawa Hospital critical care doctor Kwadwo Kyeremanteng, in an interview with CTV News Ottawa. ""I must say I'm just really happy with where we are. I'm proud of the city and everyone for doing their part. It's encouraging."" Citizens have much more freedom to gather in 2021 This time last year, Ottawa was under a ""modified Stage 2"" shutdown. Social gatherings were limited to 10 indoors and 25 outdoors, restaurants were ordered to close their dining rooms and gyms, casinos and cinemas were ordered shut. Team sports were limited to training only. Schools remained open. Today, the province has lifted a significant amount of gathering restrictions. Capacity limits are gone for large venues like live sports stadiums, and the restrictions on capacities in dining rooms and gyms end on Monday. Sara Stresman, the assistant manager of Sunset Grill in Ottawa, says this day has been a long time coming. ""I feel like we've been waiting for this for a very long time and it can finally happen,"" she said Sunday. ""Right now, 50 per cent of our tables are in storage. So, tomorrow morning, we'll be here early getting those all out, getting back to our normal floor plan and our old seating chart."" The head of Ontario's COVID-19 science table, Dr. Peter Juni, told CTV News Ottawa on Friday that Ontario's plans to further ease restrictions will be put to the test as cold weather arrives. ""The only curveball that is impending, obviously, is the bad weather. People will move indoors more, and what we need to see is how this impacts epidemic growth in this province,"" he said. Infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch says although current trends are positive, there is still a need to remain vigilant. ""It's important to recognize the pandemic isn't over and if we act like it's over we could get burned."" Vaccines and variants key differences between 2020 and 2021 The main difference between 2020 and 2021 is the vaccine. There was no approved vaccine in Canada in the fall of 2020. As of last Friday, 90 per cent of residents of Ottawa who are eligible have had at least one dose and 86 per cent are fully vaccinated. The province has created mandates requiring proof of vaccination to visit many non-essential businesses, including restaurants, but some businesses had been enforcing their own vaccination requirements before the provincial system was launched. The presence of vaccines and the widespread coverage also correlates with a markedly lower caseload in Ottawa hospitals. On Oct. 23, 2020, there were 36 COVID-19 patients in local hospitals. On Oct. 23, 2021, there were six. The 2021 fall wave peaked at 20 hospitalizations due to COVID-19, with 12 people in the ICU on Sept. 30. In the fall wave of 2020, the peak number of hospitalizations was 49 while ICU admissions peaked at 10. ""We're doing very well. Our numbers are under 10 for hospitalizations for a population of a million, so it's looking good right now,"" said Ottawa Hospital senior scientist Doug Manuel. Snapshot: Oct. 23, 2020 vs. Oct. 23, 2021 Infogram Variants are another key difference. They were not widespread in the fall of 2020. This fall, Ottawa is contending with the Delta variant. In the last 30 days, 136 cases in the city have been identified as Delta. There have been 800 Delta variant cases in the city since the first confirmed cases were reported in May. It wouldn‚Äôt be until the winter of 2020 that the first variant cases‚Äîin this case the Alpha variant‚Äîwould be detected. The Alpha variant hasn't been detected in Ottawa in the last 30 days, but is responsible for 6,849 cases since December of 2020. The number of people dying from COVID-19 has also decreased sharply since the vaccine became widely available. Twenty people in Ottawa died of COVID-19 between Oct. 1 and Oct. 23, 2020, compared to six in that same timeframe this year. The raw fatality rate of COVID-19 is 1.96 per cent, as of Oct. 23, 2021. On this date last year, that figure was 4.64 per cent. Experts say that we have come far from where we were a year ago--with other local waves in between--and as we prepare for cooler days ahead, it's important to remember the fight isn't over just yet. Doctors are encouraging everyone to continue following health guidelines through the winter. ""Our four strongest preventative measures right now are vaccination, passports, masks, and ventilation,"" Dr. Manuel says.

How did California go from COVID-19 epicenter to lowest statewide transmission rate?,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/california-epicenter-us-pandemic-lowest-statewide-transmission-rate/story?id=80661265,,,,The state has some of the strictest vaccine mandates and masking policies.,,10/24/21 18:36,"With the lowest COVID-19 infection rate among all states as of Friday, California, which has some of the strictest mask and vaccination mandates in the country, has managed to flip the script as the former U.S. epicenter of the pandemic. ""They've been very much forward-thinking in terms of policies around vaccination requirements and mandates,"" said epidemiologist Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor. As of Friday evening, California had an infection rate of 61.1 cases per 100,000 over the past week, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state was briefly the only to be classified with a ""moderate"" rate of transmission -- 10 to 49.99 cases per 100,000 over seven days -- before it went back up to ""substantial,"" meaning 50 to 99.99 cases per 100,000 over seven days. Over the previous week, Hawaii , Florida, Louisiana, Connecticut, New Jersey, Mississippi, Maryland, Georgia and Washington, D.C., each also reported ""substantial"" rates. A rate of at least 100 cases per 100,000 is labeled as ""high."" Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Alaska, as of Friday, had the highest rates over the previous seven days, with each above 450 cases per 100,000 people. The U.S. average over that span was 150.9. Experts said California's journey from worst to first is likely due to a combination of things. ""We can't know for sure which factors are responsible,"" Brownstein added, ""but we know that the combination of interventions and policies can play a really strong role in driving transmission."" 'Ending this pandemic' More than 70% of California's population has received at least one dose of vaccine, according to the CDC , and the state also leads in total vaccinations administered, roughly 53 million doses. As of Friday, the national average rate was 66.2%. Being the first state to announce a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for schools, California has some of the strictest mandates in the U.S. The state has mandated vaccines for state employees , health care workers , teachers and at large indoor gatherings . ""The more aggressive the vaccination campaign, the better,"" Dr. Todd Ellerin, director of infectious diseases at South Shore Health, told ABC News. Given that vaccines are the most powerful tool we have in curbing the spread of COVID-19, experts said they believe California's emphasis on immunizations has provided big dividends. Bloomberg via Getty Images, FILE People enter the emergency room in Redlands, Calif., Dec. 17, 2020. ""These results show quite clearly that vaccines offer protection for individuals who lack immunity, with important implications for finally ending this pandemic,"" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, wrote in a blog post Tuesday. Idaho and Wyoming have some of the lowest vaccination rates and the highest transmission rates. All three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. have since shown high effectiveness in preventing death due to COVID-19, and as of Friday, California boasted the lowest death rate in the country, with 0.3 per 100,000 over the previous week. The U.S. average over that span was 2.7 per 100,000. Additionally, experts told ABC News, having endured the harshest waves of infections last winter and the delta surge in July, formerly infected Californians may have acquired antibodies and more of a natural immunity to COVID-19 -- both factors that, in concert with vaccines, could be driving down case numbers. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images A Safeway pharmacist prepares to give a Pfizer COVID-19 booster vaccination to Chen Knifsend at a vaccination booster shot clinic, Oct. 1, 2021, in San Rafael, Calif. 'More work to do' In addition to strict vaccine mandates, California has been unwavering on face-coverings, testing and social distancing policies. ""While California has administered more vaccines than any other state, we have more work to do,"" the California Department of Public Health said in a statement to ABC News. Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, is required to wear a mask on public transit, in health care settings and at educational and correctional facilities. Masks are required for all unvaccinated people and recommended for vaccinated people in settings such as theaters, retail stores, restaurants and bars. Despite having a higher vaccination rate than California, states like Vermont are still falling behind on transmission rate rankings, which experts said points to the importance of distancing and masking. Breakthrough cases seen in Vermont can be further explained by its higher proportion of residents 65 and older. MORE: Why breakthrough COVID deaths can be misunderstood Mobility Research shows mobility, or movement in populations, can be a predictor of disease spread, especially via air travel or mass transit. This became evident through the surge of COVID-19 cases the U.S. saw during holiday season. Gov. Gavin Newsom pleaded with California residents on Christmas Eve to avoid holiday gatherings at a time when hospitals in the state were under ""unprecedented pressure."" Californian cities experienced a huge surge of cases and hospitalizations following the holidays, although rates have since declined. No stranger to stay-at-home orders, the California government imposed several lockdowns and restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. It celebrated its most recent reopening in mid-June, which replaced 15-month-long public health restrictions with conditions more akin to ""business as usual."" ""In the height of the pandemic, people were locked down, they weren't moving at all, they were staying at home,"" Brownstein told ABC News. ""The more people move around, that's usually an indicator for increased transmission."" Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images Umbrellas take over Santa Monica Beach as people head to the shoreline to beat the heat, Sept. 5, 2021, in Santa Monica, Calif. The great outdoors The virus has been shown to spread more indoors and with people in close proximity to one another. California's sunny climate means more people spend more time outside. ""When we spend most of our time indoors, that's when transmission is greatest,"" Ellerin said. MORE: Northern states see uptick in COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations as weather gets colder Added Brownstein: ""More close contacts with people outside your household indoors is what creates additional risk."" This effect is also compounded by the rise in the virus' effective reproductive number during the winter season with research suggesting that a drop in temperature encourages virus growth. Compared to many other states, especially as winter draws nearer, California is in ""quite a good spot,"" Brownstein said. ""In all likelihood, the trends that we're seeing are realistic and very much driven by compliance with masking and other interventions, plus the well-covered vaccination strategy in the state.""",https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/california-gty-er-211022_1634923576216_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abcnews

Here are 6 ways it's happening (and a good thing for women), from Kathryn Pavlovsky, Deloitte Energy.",10/24/21 18:39,"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin ‚ÄúHouston, We have a problem,‚Äù is the famous line from the movie ‚ÄúApollo 13‚Äù based on astronaut Jim Lovell‚Äôs words to NASA Mission Control during the very real near-catastrophe of its mission to the Moon when it lost electrical power on April 13, 1970. It could also summarize the state of Big Oil and the traditional energy sector in this post-covid, new ESG-focused era. ‚ÄúPut simply, the Covid-19 pandemic has created the biggest shock to the global energy system since at least World War II,‚Äù David Turk , then-Deputy Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA) told the Senate Energy and Commerce Committee on June 16, 2020. Turk is now Deputy Secretary of Energy. It also forced the much-needed transformation, according to Deloitte‚Äôs head of the Energy, Resources and Industrials practice, Kathryn Pavlovsky. She told me on my Electric Ladies podcast recently that Covid provided a ‚Äúdry-run‚Äù for Big Oil and the energy sector writ large for what we need to do to avert the irreversible, catastrophic potential impacts of climate change. ‚ÄúIt's going to be that rate of decline that is needed to achieve some of the commitments that we're making across the globe‚Ä¶by the timeline of 2050,‚Äù adding that, ‚Äúit's really interesting to see what it required in the last 18 months to actually hit that and what it means going forward.‚Äù GLASGOW, SCOTLAND - OCTOBER 13: Artists paint a mural on a a wall next to the Clydeside Expressway ...

Surround Yourself With Amazing Latina Women In past economic crises, talk of protecting the environment might have taken a back seat to getting the economy back on track. Not this time. ‚ÄúWhat is intriguing,‚Äù Pavlovsky said, ‚Äúis that the dialogue around environmental, social, governance, and climate did not slow in the (energy) sector in part, because I think it was obvious the evidence of what actually can be realized when we have, our activities reduced, whether it's on the commercial level, whether it's on the personal level.‚Äù Here are six ways Pavlovsky said covid jolted Big Oil and the energy ecosystem into an ESG-focused ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù: Kathryn Pavlovsky, head of Deloitte's Energy, Resources & Industrials practice Deloitte ¬∑ Changed demands for energy : When millions of people are continuing to work remotely, or coming to the office part-time, Pavlovsky asks, ‚ÄúAre you just displacing the consumption, or are you actually reducing it?‚Äù And, what does that mean, ‚Äúrecognizing that the cost models that (they) operated on the past, aren't going to carry forward into the future?‚Äù ¬∑ Big Oil goes ‚Äúnet zero‚Äù: ‚Äú Many (energy) companies during the height of the pandemic were announcing their net zero goals,‚Äù Pavlovsky pointed out, ‚ÄúCertain of the super majors like BP and Shell actually hardened their goals and announced production cuts going forward over the next decade through automation and looking for opportunities to do this.‚Äù BP said it will be net zero by 2050 ‚Äúor sooner,‚Äù seeking to ‚Äúdecarbonize and diversify into different forms of energy, such as renewables, biofuels ‚Äéand hydrogen,‚Äù while also keeping oil and gas in their mix. Participant seen holding a sign at the protest. Climate activists with Stop the Money Pipeline held ... [+] a rally (Photo by Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images) LightRocket via Getty Images ¬∑ Strong investor pressure: Climate-activist investors are making an impact . For example, Exxon-Mobil was forced by activist investors to swap out a couple of long-term board members for those more climate-focused. Since then, the company is reportedly considering announcing its own net zero goals. ¬∑ Increased transparency demands : The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory bodies are developing new reporting rules, based on demands from investors amid confusion due to the current array of voluntary reporting systems. Pavlovsky insists that, among Big Oil and the energy sector players overall, ‚Äúthere is a welcoming and a reception to receiving the additional guidance, to drive the consistency in the reporting‚Ä¶to having a roadmap.‚Äù She said these rules would enable more accurate comparisons between companies and industries. ¬∑ A transformed energy workplace : What does ‚Äúreturn to work‚Äù look like now in the energy sector? Pavlovsky highlighted that these massive changes converge with ‚Äúsignificant advancement in both information technology, as well as operational technologies,‚Ä¶ (for example) the pandemic was certainly an accelerator for digital.‚Äù These both change the configuration of the energy sector workplace and could smooth the transition to this ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù that demands less energy, less fossil fuel and dramatically fewer emissions. ‚ÄúWe did see that the industry accelerated its energy transition.‚Äù Woman in STEM Christina Morillo for pexels ¬∑ New needs and new skills create a more diverse workforce : One of the most intriguing things Pavlovsky said in our interview is that the rapid shift to new information, digital and operational technologies expedited by Covid-19 opens job and career opportunities for more diverse populations. ‚ÄúIf you look at the challenges ahead of the industry and ESG and,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand what has been forced through the pandemic, it actually opens up, I think the option to really drive more diversity, and attract more women to the workforce.‚Äù She added that, ‚Äúthe combination of the nature of the work and the reskilling, as well as the hybrid model and, and what they open up for women in terms of creating more flexibility.‚Äù Now for the hard part though. The pandemic forced the energy sector to address all this low-hanging fruit in their business models and operations to reduce emissions and pivot to the new demands. ‚ÄúWe're now getting to a place in the journey where it's getting harder,‚Äù Pavlovsky says. But the energy sector can play a crucial role in ESG 2.0. ‚ÄúThey also recognize they can be a really significant part of the solution‚Ä¶..(and) can contribute. Whether it's our technological solutions, whether it's the talent that we bring to the market, we actually have a real role in shaping this across industries and sectors globally.‚Äù Listen to Joan‚Äôs full interview with Kathryn Pavlovsky on Electric Ladies podcast here .",https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/0x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/6175a2ab94c2b393721d73f1/0x0.jpg,forbes

Residents in swaths of the province will be allowed to attend events like hockey games, concerts and weddings without any limits on numbers, but capacity will be capped at 50 per cent in areas where vaccination rates are low, including parts of the Fraser, Northern and Interior health regions.

The move was eagerly anticipated by businesses, including those that require bookings well in advance for events like weddings.

Sooch said the hall has been booked for two upcoming gatherings for Diwali ‚Äî one next Saturday and another two weeks later ‚Äî and he‚Äôs hoping the business will start thriving again as more people return to socializing as usual. But Sooch said not everyone is ready for pre-pandemic-type parties while they still need to wear masks, especially seniors waiting for booster shots and families with children under 12 who can‚Äôt yet be vaccinated.

Story continues below advertisement ‚ÄúThere are a lot of people who are immunocompromised or have other reasons to be concerned, who feel like there isn‚Äôt transparency,‚Äù she said, noting parents of schoolchildren in the Vancouver area spearheaded their own efforts to document and share COVID-19 exposures so families could decide to keep their child home to protect older or ill individuals. Read more: COVID-19: B.C. reports 13 deaths and 649 new cases, posts nearly 200 fatalities in a month Government announcements about reopenings should include messaging for people who are reluctant to resume activities while the pandemic is ongoing, Tworek said. The day after capacity limits lift, British Columbia will require all health-care workers in the province to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, after an Oct. 12 deadline for employees in long-term care and assisted living facilities. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has said she expanded her order to all health-care settings partly to prevent unvaccinated staff working with seniors from jumping to jobs elsewhere.

The singer ‚Äì who was scheduled to appear on the November 6 show ‚Äì announced via Instagram on Sunday that he tested positive for the coronavirus. Now, SNL producers are ‚Äúscrambling‚Äù to find a replacement. A source tells us that Sheeran, 30, will not be allowed into the US with a positive COVID-19 test. They‚Äôre looking to replace him with ‚Äúanother singer who appeals to the same demo,‚Äù the source says, someone like Shawn Mendes or Justin Bieber. According to the insider, there‚Äôs also a chance SNL could let Sheeran perform remotely, though that has yet to be decided. ‚ÄúEd is offering to perform live via video link, but this isn‚Äôt something ‚ÄòSNL‚Äô does,‚Äù the source told us. ‚ÄúThe show likes to have the performer in studio.‚Äù A representative for Sheeran did not immediately respond to Page Six‚Äôs request for comment. Earlier Sunday, Sheeran broke the news of his diagnosis to his fans on Instagram , writing, ‚ÄúHey guys. Quick note to tell you that I‚Äôve sadly tested positive for Covid, so I‚Äôm now self-isolating and following government guidelines.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm now unable to plough ahead with any in person commitments for now, so I‚Äôll be doing as many of my planned interviews/performances I can from my house,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúApologies to anyone I‚Äôve let down. Be safe everyone x.‚Äù Sheeran‚Äôs fourth studio album, = (pronounced ‚ÄúEquals‚Äù), is still expected for release on October 29. Back in June, Sheeran gushed about how his creative process has changed since becoming a father. The Perfect singer and his wife, Cherry Seaborn, welcomed their first child together ‚Äì daughter Lyra ‚Äì in August 2020. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very structured with my day now so like usually if I was in the studio I would just kind of work until it was done,‚Äù he said at the time. ‚ÄúI feel like with a kid you need a structured workday. You can‚Äôt be working until 2 o‚Äôclock in the morning.‚Äù Of learning how to successfully parent, Sheeran added, ‚ÄúNo parent knows what they‚Äôre doing.‚Äù This story originally appeared on Page Six and is republished here with permission. Elton John is the second knight of rock to do a star-studded iso-album this year PLUS Hayley Jensen and Bagful of Beez.

The independent expert body has previously hinted a big rise for 2022 is coming but there is concern in the Treasury about the impact on small businesses. The PM told the Conservative Party conference in Manchester this month: ‚ÄúWe are not going back to the same old broken model with low wages, low growth, low skills and low productivity.‚Äù And he urged businesses to put up wages. But senior Tories are very aware such a plea would need to be matched by the Government giving support.

Read More","It was one of Australia‚Äôs first big and powerful gaming machines now Alienware is 25 years old and still making an impression with the Company now working with JB Hi Fi to expand their top end PC gaming offering in Australia. To celebrate the milestone, the Dell owned company has announced a redesigned flagship gaming desktop, Aurora. The new desktop has an open-air design that promotes better accessibility, airflow, and cleaner cable management. The timing is perfect claim observers with COVID creating a new generation of PC gamers, many who are deserting console gaming replacing their consoles with gaming PCs from the likes of MSI, Acer, Lenovo and Alienware. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and into 2022, many people turned to video gaming as a form of entertainment during long periods of being locked down at home claim analysts. Year-over-year growth has been immense claim IDC analysts, with gaming monitor and gaming PC shipments in the second quarter increasing 19.3% over last year despite shipping delays and component shortages. Market analysis firm IDC itself notes that the rapid growth in the gaming market through last year and into this year was driven by the global COVID-19 pandemic, and that some analysts expect the demand for PC gaming machines to continue. During a recent survey by Roy Morgan PC gamers stated that their time spent playing fighting games had increased by 24 percent. The new Alienware machine has been designed for PC gamers who relish in performance. Alienware has increased the internal chassis volume by 50 percent and added four 120mm fans and liquid cooling options to create a more efficient airflow to keep the PC from overheating. When compared to its predecessors, the new Aurora desktop CPU temperatures are three percent lower. The unique honeycomb-shaped airways assist in increasing airflow efficiency by taking in cool air and moving it across the motherboard and performance components before pushing it out through the back of the chassis. Alienware offers an optional transparent panel for the left side of the chassis so that gamers can see the motherboard inside. The right side of the chassis can be removed without using a tool, which makes it easy for gamers to customize their device however they like. the new Aurora is also 16 percent quieter when idle, nine percent quieter during CPU intensive tasks like gaming and streaming, and 15 percent quieter during overclocking.",10/24/21 21:37,,,channelnews
"Moderna COVID booster: What to know about mix and match, who can get it and when - CNET",https://www.cnet.com/health/moderna-covid-booster-what-to-know-about-mix-and-match-who-can-get-it-and-when/#ftag=CADf328eec,,['Clifford Colby'],,You might be eligible to get the Moderna booster shot now. Here's what we know.,,10/24/21 21:38,"Moderna boosters are here. Algi Febri Sugita/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images For the most up-to-date news and information about the coronavirus pandemic, visit the WHO and CDC websites. The Moderna booster shot against COVID-19 got the green light last week after lengthy debate that culminated in the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention authorizing the drug for a third dose. But that doesn't mean it'll be available to everyone -- at least not yet. We'll walk you through who's eligible to receive the Moderna booster shot, when, and what the deal is with mixing and matching vaccine brands . Authorization for the Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson booster shots comes at a time when the deadly and highly contagious delta variant surged in the US, causing hospitals in some states to once again buckle. With cases, hospitalizations and deaths beginning to plateau, epidemiologists worry about another wave of COVID infections as cold weather drives people indoors in closer quarters, and as the annual flu season begins to kick in, eroding immune systems. The FDA-approved COVID vaccines have proven to be highly effective in preventing hospitalization, and those who are unvaccinated are 10 times more likely to be hospitalized . With the new federal vaccine mandates , the Biden administration aims to counter the surge and put pressure on anyone who hasn't been vaccinated. Keep reading for more details on Moderna's COVID-19 booster shot. For more on COVID-19, here's the latest on COVID-19 vaccines for kids , what to do if you lost your vaccination card , the difference between a booster and a third dose and breakthrough infections . Now playing: Watch this: COVID-19 boosters and the delta variant: What you need... 7:23 Who can get a Moderna COVID-19 booster shot now? The FDA authorized a Moderna vaccine booster for Moderna recipients age 65 years of age and older and adults who are at high risk because of severe illness or exposure in their work setting. Additionally, all Johnson & Johnson recipients age 18 and older will also be able to get a Moderna booster after two months of getting vaccinated, and will be eligible for Pfizer's booster . Those who are eligible can get their shots now. The CDC recommends the following get their booster shot six months after they've been fully vaccinated with either Pfizer or Moderna. People who are: 65 years and older 18 or older who live in long-term care settings 18 or older who have underlying medical conditions 18 or older who work or live in high-risk settings Yes, you can now mix and match vaccines The FDA has authorized mixing COVID boosters , which in the US includes Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. Anyone eligible for a booster can get any of the available brands of coronavirus vaccines. If you received Johnson and Johnson, you'll be able to get the Moderna or Pfizer booster if it's been two months or longer since you received the initial dose. If you received Moderna or Pfizer for your first two shots, you could get any vaccine -- including J&J -- if it's been six months or longer since your second shot. CNET Health and Wellness Our Health & Wellness newsletter puts the best products, updates and advice in your inbox. What does the Moderna booster shot do? A COVID-19 booster shot -- whether from Moderna, Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson -- would top off your immune response and guard against a breakthrough COVID infection as the vaccine's effectiveness decreases. Recent studies of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines show that their effectiveness can begin to wane after six months. Moderna said early data suggests that those who received the Moderna vaccine in 2020 are showing a higher rate of breakthrough COVID infections than those vaccinated this year, suggesting the need for a booster to maintain high levels of protection. Is the Moderna booster shot the same as the original COVID-19 doses? Yes, almost. As with Pfizer's booster, the third Moderna shot will be the same vaccine as the first two doses, except it'll be a half dose. To make your life simpler, Moderna is also working on a combination shot that includes this year's flu vaccine and its COVID-19 booster vaccine, but that is not available right now. Where can I get the Moderna booster shot? According to the White House , boosters will be available at roughly 80,000 places across the country, including over 40,000 local pharmacies. Some 90% of Americans have a vaccine site within 5 miles of where they live. You can check Vaccines.gov to see which vaccines are available where, or call 1-800-232-0233 for vaccine information. Is the Moderna COVID-19 booster shot free or do I have to pay? All booster shots will be free regardless of immigration or health insurance status. However, depending on where you get your booster shot -- for example at a local pharmacy -- you may be asked to log your insurance status. For example, you may be asked to provide your insurance card information, including your name, date of birth and membership number. You will not be charged for your COVID vaccine or booster shot. For more on coronavirus treatments and vaccines, here's what we know about monoclonal antibody treatments , the new federal vaccine mandates and why some people may not want the shot . Will I need a fourth COVID booster shot? While this question has been raised, there's no current plan to decide on a fourth Moderna booster shot at this time. We'll keep you updated as the situation develops. CNET's Jessica Rendall contributed to this article.

It locked down thousands of people in the North.Top U.S. health officials signaled confidence that children ages 5 to 11 will begin getting Covid-19 vaccines by early November. The Pfizer vaccines will likely be given at pediatricians‚Äô offices rather than at pharmacies or large sites.Singapore health officials deployed their fake-news law against the ‚ÄúTruth Warriors‚Äù website for making claims regarding vaccine effectiveness and ivermectin‚Äôs use as a treatment, among other things.Key Developments:Virus Tracker: Cases top 243.6 million; deaths surpass 4.9 millionVaccine Tracker: More than 6.86 billion shots givenResurgent Covid means it could be another tough winterDelta variant is bolstering the case for booster shots: QuickTakeSingapore Issues Fake-News Directive Against Website (10:03 a.m. HK)Singapore‚Äôs Ministry of Health has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) Office to issue a Correction Direction to the ‚ÄúTruth Warriors‚Äù website for assertions related to the effectiveness of Covid vaccines, use of ivermectin as a treatment and more.Read more: Singapore Deploys its Fake News Law Against Anti-Vaxxer GroupJokowi Pushes for Southeast Asia Travel Arrangement (9:58 a.m. HK)Indonesia‚Äôs President Joko Widodo pushed for travel to reopen in Southeast Asia, saying this would help economic recovery in the region that has seen coronavirus cases recede.He said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations needs to hit its vaccination target of 70% of the population of over 650 million people as soon as possible so that economies could reopen safely.Jokowi, as the president‚Äôs known, has been pushing for a regional travel corridor arrangement since late last year. Instead, each country has set up bilateral deals with nations around the world, with Singapore reopening to North America and Europe while Thailand scrapped quarantine rules for 46 countries while excluding Indonesia.Read more: Jokowi Pushes for Southeast Asian Travel ArrangementChina Locks Down Thousands in North (9:55 a.m. HK)China locked down a county that has seen the most Covid-19 cases in the country‚Äôs latest delta outbreak, as an initial flareup in the northwest quickly spirals into a nationwide surge.Ejin, a county in northwestern China‚Äôs Inner Mongolia, has asked its 35,700 residents to stay home from Monday and warned of civil and criminal liabilities should anyone disobey the order, state broadcaster CCTV reported, citing a local government statement. The small county bordering Mongolia is the current outbreak‚Äôs hotspot, home to nearly one-third of the more than 150 infections found over the past week in the mainland.The lockdown came a day after a warning from National Health Commission officials that the outbreak would continue to worsen after spreading to 11 provinces in about a week. China reported 38 Covid infections on Monday, half of which were found in Inner Mongolia.Read more: China Locks Down Thousands in North as Delta Outbreak SpreadsSouth Korea to Start Return to ‚ÄòNormal Life‚Äô (9:42 a.m. HK)South Korea will begin a ‚Äúgradual return to normal life‚Äù in Nov. as 70% of the population has been fully vaccinated, President Moon Jae-in said at the National Assembly.

The encounter, earlier reported by Florida Politics, took place between Senator Tina Polsky and Joseph Ladapo, who met her in her office regarding his upcoming confirmation after being appointed by Governor Ron DeSantis. She has been diagnosed with breast cancer. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs very smug,‚Äù Polsky said. ‚ÄúAnd I told him several times, ‚ÄòI have this very serious medical condition.‚Äô And he said, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs OK,‚Äô like it basically has nothing to do with what we are talking about.‚Äô‚ÄùLadapo has questioned the vaccine‚Äôs efficacy and safety, and like DeSantis, opposes shot mandates. Florida was hit hard by the latest wave of the virus, accounting at one point for a fifth of U.S. cases. Pediatricians Should Vaccinate Kids, Gottlieb Says (1:09 p.m. NY)Children ages 5 to 11 should be vaccinated in their pediatrician‚Äôs offices, said Scott Gottlieb, former head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. He‚Äôs a board member of Pfizer Inc., whose vaccine is to be considered for authorization for young children. ‚ÄúGetting children vaccinated is a much more consultative endeavor,‚Äù Gottlieb said on CBS‚Äôs ‚ÄúFace the Nation.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want children to have to go to mass vaccination sites or even necessarily a pharmacy. You want them to go into the comfort of their own pediatrician‚Äôs office.‚ÄùHe said the vaccine, developed with BioNTec SE, will be packaged for doctors‚Äô offices.U.S. Kids Set for Shots by Early November (11:30 a.m. NY)Two top U.S. health officials signaled confidence that children ages 5 to 11 will begin getting Covid-19 vaccines by early November. ‚ÄúIf all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval ... it‚Äôs entirely possible if not very likely that vaccines will be available for children from five to 11 within the first week or two of November,‚Äù Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden‚Äôs chief medical adviser, said on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Week.‚ÄùHis comments were echoed by Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which must ultimately approve the shots. ‚ÄúThere will be vaccine out there so children can start rolling up their sleeves,‚Äù Walensky said on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeet the Press.‚ÄùHealth experts say vaccinating children will be a key step in helping end the U.S. outbreak, though a Kaiser Family Foundation study found in September that only about a third of parents would vaccinate their children immediately. Almost 65 million eligible Americans ages 12 and older are not vaccinated. Advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will meet Tuesday to consider data for children‚Äôs use of the vaccine by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. Approval by the FDA and the CDC is also required.Sunak Plays Down New U.K. Curbs (6:18 a.m. NY)U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak told the BBC that available Covid-19 data don‚Äôt support a move to harsher restrictions. Speaking against a backdrop of rising virus cases and ahead of his budget this week, Sunak said a return to the furlough program that saw the government pay as much as 80% of the wages of idled workers was not on the cards. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt envisage having to impose significant economic restrictions in the way that we had to over the last year.‚ÄùMalaysia Sees Further Drop in Cases (4:49 p.m. HK)Malaysia recorded the fewest cases since the end of June. The Southeast Asian country added 5,666 new infections Sunday, bringing the total number of cases to more than 2.43 million, according to a tweet by Health Malaysia Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah. Meanwhile, almost 95% of Malaysia‚Äôs adult population have received a complete dose of vaccines, according to the health ministry‚Äôs data.Russia Deaths, Cases Remain Near Record (4:17 p.m. HK)Russian coronavirus cases and deaths remained near record levels on Sunday ahead of the implementation of strict nationwide curbs to stem a surge in infections.There were 35,660 new cases and 1,072 deaths over the past day, slightly below records set Saturday, according to data from the national coronavirus headquarters. Last week, President Vladimir Putin ordered nationwide non-working days for the first week of November to slow the spread, while Moscow will be closed for most business from Oct. 28 through Nov. 7.China Expects Outbreak to Widen (4:08 p.m. HK)China‚Äôs new Covid-19 infections will increase in coming days and the areas affected by the pandemic may continue to expand.The current outbreak in China is caused by the delta variant, Wu Liangyou, an official at the National Health Commission, said at a briefing in Beijing on Sunday. The outbreak has expanded to 11 provinces in the week since Oct. 17, Mi Feng, a spokesman for the commission, said at the same briefing.Earlier on Sunday, Beijing authorities announced the city is halting cross-province tourism and closing card and majhong rooms. China‚Äôs capital will also cut the number of large events and increase supervision over small clinics and pharmacies, according to the official WeChat account of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission.Belgium to Weigh Stricter Rules (3:21 p.m. HK)Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo will meet with his cabinet Monday to discuss the virus situation and consider tighter curbs. The government is mulling a return to stricter mask rules, Belga reports, citing a government spokesman. Belgium, like other European countries, is seeing rising infections, with more than 8.5 million of a population of about 11.5 million being fully vaccinated. ¬©2021 Bloomberg L.P.With assistance from Bloomberg.

It was one of the first nations to successfully issue lock-downs, pursue contact tracing, and develop a robust federal infrastructure dedicated towards fighting the spread of the disease. However, this year has been challenging for the country, especially as the infamous Delta variant became more prevalent. India is home to nearly 1.4 billion people. Amidst the immense population, bustling economy, and deeply rooted cultural paradigms that define the nation, there is also a relative respect for health, science, and self-betterment. That is, India has always been an epicenter for healthcare innovation and holistic medicine, in addition to being the modern day mecca for the world‚Äôs pharmaceutical needs . But India‚Äôs latest milestone is something for the history books: achieving 1 billion vaccinations in less than a year. This means that nearly 75% of the population has received at least one dose of the vaccine, providing incredible hope for the future of the country‚Äôs fight against the pandemic. For sake of comparison, in the USA, 66.6% of the population has currently received atleast one dose, and in Canada, 77% of the population has received atleast one dose.

(Photo by Dibyangshu SARKAR / AFP) (Photo by DIBYANGSHU SARKAR/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images But this is an especially monumental feat for India. One of the foremost problems that the nation continues to face is an incredibly large population‚Äî an issue which often creates challenges that other countries may take for granted, such as vaccine distribution.

(Photo by INDRANIL MUKHERJEE / AFP) (Photo by INDRANIL MUKHERJEE/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images Compound these supply-chain issues with: a large part of the population living outside of big, metropolitan areas; a much younger, though advanced, infrastructure system; and an incredibly diverse yet largely people-driven economy‚Äî and one realizes the challenges that India faces on a daily basis. This is why a feat such as achieving 1 billion vaccinations cannot be taken for granted in a place like India‚Äîit simply isn‚Äôt the same as achieving the same percentage in the USA, or Canada. There are a far different set of intricate nuances to consider. Understanding these nuances brings forth a renewed appreciation for the achievement. Overall, the milestone also perfectly encapsulates India‚Äôs dual interests. While cultural norms and deeply historic roots are pervasive throughout Indian culture, there is also a strong commitment towards innovation, science, and preservation of health. India is home to some of the most advanced healthcare innovation, research and development, and medical technologies in the world. It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs largest vaccine producer (even prior to Covid), and has forged incredible pathways into robotics, telemedicine, and preventative care. And perhaps most importantly with regards to modern healthcare, the government is committed to embracing cutting-edge digital health strategies . Overall, India is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to research and development on multiple fronts, but especially with regards to science and innovation. Time will tell what will happen in the coming months and years with regards to the Covid-19 Coronavirus pandemic. India, like every other country, is not immune to the constant ebbs-and-flows of the virus; just when case counts start to drop, new variants emerge or new outbreaks occur, sending entire countries back into surge protocols. However, with the information that the world has on hand currently, and based on the current knowledge-base and recommendations provided by public health officials, this milestone marks a promising effort by India in its fight against the virus.",https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/0x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/6175b4e21d27fa82b64d1796/0x0.jpg,forbes
‚ÄòThey went above and beyond‚Äô: Celebrating good customer service by Irish businesses,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/consumer/they-went-above-and-beyond-celebrating-good-customer-service-by-irish-businesses-1.4704571?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"As keen readers will know, we spend much of our time on this page giving out. If we are not moaning about high prices we are complaining about terrible customer service. And we make no apologies for that. But every now and then it is worth acknowledging that amidst all the horror stories and the let downs there are many thousands of businesses and people who do the right thing and look after their customers. often when it doesn‚Äôt benefit them at all. They just do the right thing because they are sound. So, what with it being a bank holiday and all ‚Äì and one which is always pretty depressing, heralding as it does the start of winter ‚Äì we thought we would stand down our gripes for the day and hand the page over to those with good news stories to share. It‚Äôs time to celebrate the sound. Stena Line A reader by the name of John Daly was due to travel to UK with Stena Line earlier this month ‚ÄúI assumed that the ferry was departing at 20.55. Unfortunately that was the departure time for Irish Ferries crossing. Stena was departing at 20.30.‚Äù Around 25 minutes before the boat was due to set sail Daly‚Äôs phone rang. ‚ÄúI was on the M50 when I received a call. The lady asked me where I was. I replied that I was on the M50, near the port tunnel. She replied saying that ‚ÄòWe will wait for you. Put your foot down‚Äô. I couldn‚Äôt imagine our biggest airline doing that. So 10 /10 for Stena. I was the last to board.‚Äù Maybe Daly was being a bit harsh on airlines when he said they‚Äôd not be so accommodating to dallying passengers. Because as it happens we also got a mail from a reader in connection with Aer Lingus, a company which has come in for its fair share of criticism on this page over recent years. Aer Lingus Shane Colton ‚Äúfelt compelled to send in my positive experience‚Äù with the airline because ‚Äúthere are so many examples nowadays of poor customer service so nice to be able to call out positives when possible!‚Äù Colton was heading to London a few weeks ago and he admits that it had been so long since he‚Äôd been on a plane that he was out of practice. Aren‚Äôt we all? ‚ÄúI decided there was no point going down to the gate too early and instead was relaxing over my pint in the bar. Needless to say I was cutting it a bit too ‚Äòjust in time‚Äô and as I was strolling down to the gate, my name got called out over the intercom to go to the gate. Next thing the guy from the gate rang my mobile phone to check was I lost or if I was on my way (they could probably tell I had checked in),‚Äù he writes So after ‚Äúputting an inch to my final step and being mortified at being last to board the plane, I now learned to not only check which gate your flying from, but the time the gate closes. I was deeply grateful to them for the gentle nudge as I highly doubt the other low-cost airlines would have done the same. Having to sit around the airport all day, rearranging alternative flights and costing a fortune would have lost me day one of my weekend trip and ultimately soured my weekend. I‚Äôm a big believer in customer service not being all high and fancy, it can be very small simple acts of kindness.‚Äù Irish Ferries We also heard from an Irish Ferries customer. It‚Äôs another company which has featured on this page in a less positive fashion of late. ‚ÄúGiven the many problems that you have covered with refunds and vouchers for travel cancelled due to the pandemic, I wanted to report a recent, very positive experience with Irish Ferries,‚Äù says Bairbre Redmond. ‚ÄúIn early 2020 I had paid ‚Ç¨1,500 for a return Dublin-Cherbourg trip for June 2020. I cancelled the trip in May 2020 and opted to take a voucher rather than a refund. This was partly because the voucher was going to be good for travel up to the end of 2021 (when travel in that period looked to be a lot more viable than it turned out to be). As I was lucky enough to afford it, I also wanted to try and support Irish Ferries by leaving the money with them; we‚Äôve travelled with them annually to France for 12 years and have always had very good experiences with them.‚Äù Fast forward to last spring when it became clear travel to France was not going to be a runner in the summer of 2021 either. ‚ÄúI began to think that my magnanimous gesture of taking a voucher might have been a bit foolish,‚Äù Redmond says. ‚ÄúI wrote to Irish Ferries asking if they would allow us to book travel for 2022 using the ‚Ç¨1,500 voucher. Their subsequent reply did not say that it would be possible, but asked me to ‚Äúrevert back to us near end of 2021 and we can favourably review for extension of the travel credit, taking into consideration the value of credit you currently have held‚Äù. While hopeful, I had been increasingly nervous that Irish Ferries could still limit or refuse to honour the voucher as we wouldn‚Äôt be using it for travel in 2021.‚Äù The 2022 Ireland-France travel bookings opened last week and Redmond ‚Äúprepared for a lengthy dispute to be able to use our voucher for a post-2021 booking. ‚ÄúI phoned them this morning and, with no issue, was told that I could use the entire amount against a 2022 booking and was helpfully talked through how to draw down the credit on an online booking. An hour later the Irish Ferries agent (Paula) phoned me back to make sure I had been able to complete this as she was concerned that she might have misled me on using one aspect of their (new) booking system. Credit where it‚Äôs due, an extremely positive experience (and an excellent booking agent). Apart from being a long-time customer with Irish Ferries, I have no other connection with the company.‚Äù Promise Gluten Free Sorcha King wanted us to highlight what she said was ‚Äúa small gesture but [one which] made me feel important as a customer. King‚Äôs husband and son are both coeliac so the family spend a lot on gluten-free foods. ‚ÄúA few weeks ago I bought sandwich baps from Promise Gluten Free ( an Irish company based in Donegal). The baps were four days within the best-before date and still sealed but unfortunately had a patch of mould so I took a picture and emailed it to them,‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄúI got a lovely email back,‚Äù she says. The company accepted that there was an issue ‚Äì it is one which is, King tells us much worse in warmer weather. ‚ÄúThey apologised and asked for my address to send out a hamper in the post. A big box arrived a couple of days later filled with a large selection of their breads. I wasn‚Äôt expecting such a lovely hamper. It will stick with me the way they treated my complaint and I reach for their products when shopping.‚Äù First Stop Paul Doyle has not one but two good news stories he wanted us to share. First up was First Stop in the Omni Shopping Centre in Santry. ‚ÄúThese guys always go further to make getting our three cars sorted. From tyres to batteries, full service to brakes, they are always friendly, search for best prices for parts. They keep you informed by phone and are apologetic when the bill is big because something needs to be done. The management and team always have time to explain and show you what needs to be done. And, they are friendly in a natural ‚ÄòDub‚Äô way. Every time for years now. Exceptional. And all of four of us have had the same individual experience.‚Äù Shouk Doyle also had a shout out for Shouk, the restaurant in Drumcondra. ‚ÄúThey had a problem one evening, we had to wait 25 minutes for our online takeaway pickup. The team were totally apologetic, kept us informed of the likely delay and were polite and calm. They said they would be in touch. Two days later I got a call from them, explaining what happened, apologising again and hoping it would not affect our custom. Then, I was asked if I would give my email as they would like to sent me a small voucher. They sent a ‚Ç¨15 voucher with a further apology. Their approach was friendly, efficient and clearly made us feel we were important to them. In both cases there is clearly a customer ethos from management down. Rare and natural in both cases.‚Äù Feeney‚Äôs of Dromore West Catherine Sheridan mailed us because she wanted to share a good experience she had with Feeney‚Äôs of Dromore West in Co Sligo. ‚ÄúI was involved with a local government management agency conference this week. I was speaking about the economic opportunities arising from climate change. I had hoped to make it to a hotel in time to give my presentation but I got my timings wrong,‚Äù she says. That makes her the third reader of this page this week to get their timings wrong. ‚ÄúWe stopped at Feeney‚Äôs and explained our predicament. They sorted me with WiFi and set me up in their coffee shop where I was able to deliver my presentation. I‚Äôd like to I say to rapturous applause but it really wasn‚Äôt that sort of an audience. However it was incredible that I could. It was because of the attitude of the team in Feeneys. They went above and beyond for me and it was so, so brilliant.‚Äù Butternut Box Melanie Morris signed up to Butternut Box recently. It is a home-cooked, human-grade dog food and she had heard the business story and liked how they conducted themselves on various public platforms. ‚ÄúI ordered my first two-week batch late one evening using Apple Pay, which is connected to my Revolut card. I loved the service, Flumpy loved the food, I stayed on as a subscriber,‚Äù Morris says. ‚ÄúMy payment didn‚Äôt go through this week (I should have switched to my more regular visa debit card), and they emailed me to politely let me know‚Ä¶. And that they would be sending by out my delivery anyhow, in the meantime.‚Äù She describes this attitude ‚Äì rightly ‚Äì as ‚Äúreally impressive. They also have a 24/7 vet nurse hotline for Butternutters, just like VHI for human members.‚Äù CliffRun Media Brigid Flanagan wanted to give a shout out to CliffRun Media. ‚ÄúMy mother uses their Acorn, a tablet-like device for older people. She bought it during the first lockdown so she could keep in touch with people and watch mass/attend funerals virtually. It stopped working recently. We shipped it back to CliffRun Media. The long and short of it is that [the company] called today to let me know they can‚Äôt fix it but will provide her with a replacement, a refurbished one, at no charge.‚Äù Connolly Hospital Cian Conroy and a friend were knocked off their bicycles earlier this month ‚Äì he chooses not to dwell on the driver‚Äôs role in the incident. ‚ÄúThe extent of our injuries meant we both had to be rushed to A&E by ambulance and to then receive extensive treatment from the medical staff in A&E and the wider facilities in Connolly Hospital,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúEverybody we encountered went out of their way not only to restore our bodies but also to lift our spirits. They were professional, attentive and courteous at every interaction. The staff were from every corner of the earth, New Zealand, South Africa, Nigeria, England and closer to home. I couldn‚Äôt name them all, and probably due to Covid masks I may not recognise them if we meet again, but would hope a name check of Blanchardstown A&E might in some way convey my thanks.‚Äù Done. Shout-outs ‚ÄúA few weeks ago in Tower Records I sat down on the stairs to breastfeed the baby... one of the staff members was over in about five seconds to see if I wanted a chair.‚Äù ‚Äì Liz O‚ÄôSullivan ‚ÄúThe staff at the checkout in Aldi Wexford are amazing when my husband, who has dementia, is trying to pay with pre-decimal coins.‚Äù ‚Äì Patricia Stafford ‚ÄúHairy Baby have a girl called Dee who‚Äôs just exemplary. Bought a load of t-shirts for presents, one had tiny hole in it. I was expecting big rigmarole to get replacement but after an email, a new one arrived in two days ‚Äì no hassle, no stress. Presents were all a great hit.‚Äù ‚Äì Orlaith Read ‚ÄúDee from Hairy Baby also helped me out with a reprint of a t-shirt from over 10 years ago. So helpful and lovely.‚Äù ‚Äì Aideen Nolan ‚ÄúHilary from The Mill Pharmacy, Coolaney went out of her way to help me get my medication on time last week when I got discharged from hospital. Don‚Äôt know what I would have done without her.‚Äù ‚Äì Jennifer Devaney Gaughan ‚ÄúWe booked in for two nights in the Bloomfield Hotel with our two smallies in a family room. Had to leave after the first night (our own fault) and they refunded the second night. Amazing gesture, wasn‚Äôt expecting it at all. Fab hotel, fab pool, gorgeous location.‚Äù ‚Äì Sara McGough. ‚ÄúMyself and a friend in Glengarriff for a weekend, booked a taxi back to cottage after meal, realised we had no cash, taxi driver didn‚Äôt take card ‚Äì no ATMs open. He brought us home anyway as he didn‚Äôt want to see us stranded and walking in the dark ‚Äì gent.‚Äù ‚Äì Hazel Nolan ‚ÄúSailed home on an overnight ferry with Stena Line. Noisy people in the lounge.

In the early states of the Covid pandemic, much credit was paid to the South Korean state for its effective response to the pandemic. Part of the reason for their preparedness can be traced back to a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) outbreak there in 2015. It involved 186 cases and caused 38 deaths. The estimated impact on tourism alone was $2.6 billion, or about $14 million per case (Joo et al, Health Security 2019). The full impact on their economy was perhaps four times as high. Thus they were ready to act rapidly when Covid-19 appeared, fearing the costs of inaction. An entirely different approach, which incorporates the logic of insurance, is to look at the premium workers are paid to take on high-risk occupations and to correlate the excess payment with the actuarial risk they assume. For example a profession that carries a 1 per cent risk of death will attract extra payment. If that excess is multiplied by 100, then the market value of a life can, as offensive as it sounds, be quantified. This logic in the US gives a figure of about $10 million. In healthcare resourcing one must also at times factor in the opportunity cost, which is particularly relevant to ICU admission.

Trade unionism is emerging from the pandemic in good shape,https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/trade-unionism-is-emerging-from-the-pandemic-in-good-shape-1.4709527?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"It is nearly 15 years since the then taoiseach Bertie Ahern departed from his scripted address to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu) and wondered aloud why critics of his ‚ÄúCeltic tiger‚Äù economic model did not kill themselves. Within a short period the fears of these critics materialised. The economic crash that followed changed the world of work. The numbers in employment fell from 2.169 million in the third quarter of 2007 to 1.825 million at its lowest point in early 2012.Across the public service there were two, and in some cases three, separate pay cuts imposed. The post-crash austerity also swept away the system of social partnership which for more than two decades had given trade unions (and some employer groups) huge influence, not just over the levels of pay rises but also across a large range of social, political and economic issues. While there have been some torrid times for the trade union movement over the past 12 years or so, when Ictu meets in conference in Belfast this week it will do so in a more positive environment than in a considerable period of time. Covid-19 transformed the world of work again. It led to work practice reforms and flexibilities that would have proved impossible to achieve or at the very least involved years of tortuous negotiations. Hundreds of thousands of workers left their offices and embraced technology to continue doing their jobs. State employees were redeployed to different roles virtually overnight, while health service personnel left the public system to provide services in private sector nursing homes, as did Defence Force members. However, the pandemic has also led to a major change in the attitude of Government to the world of work and to workers‚Äô rights. In a series of speeches over recent months T√°naiste Leo Varadkar has argued that one of the legacies of the pandemic must be better terms and conditions. In sentiments that could have been articulated by David Begg, Jack O‚ÄôConnor, Patricia King or many of the main trade union leaders over recent years, he has backed a move to a living wage, the need for access to an occupational pension, the right to disconnect from work, the right to seek remote working arrangements and for new legislation for statutory sick pay arrangements. However, for the unions the big announcement by Varadkar was the establishment of a high-level group to look at collective bargaining and industrial relations. Constitutional right Traditionally Ireland has followed what is known as a voluntarist system of industrial relations. Workers had a constitutional right to join a trade union. However, employers equally had a right not to recognise or engage with trade unions. The new review group is looking at the issue of trade union recognition and its implications for collective bargaining, as well as considering any legal or constitutional issues. Unions had been campaigning for years for collective bargaining rights but there seemed little appetite for change on the part of successive governments. Whether anything substantial emerges from the new process remains to be seen. However, for the unions getting the Government into a space where it would establish a group to look at potential reforms in this area represented a step forward. The trade union movement would appear to have emerged relatively unscathed from the past 18 months in terms of workers it represents Some observers have questioned the motivation of Varadkar, and wondered if he has an eye on closing off potential avenues of political attack from Sinn F√©in, which has championed workers‚Äô rights for many years. However, unions are likely to watch carefully to see the tangible benefits on the ground from the various measures, particularly for the more vulnerable groups of workers in the private sector. The conference this week is likely to hear about the role Ictu played as the voice for all workers during the pandemic, not just those represented by a trade union. A lot of this work was carried out under the auspices of the Labour Employer Economic Forum. The LEEF, as it is known, was considered a dim echo of social partnership and provided a vehicle role for employers, unions and the Government to discuss issues such as competitiveness, job-creation and labour market standards. However, during Covid-19 it evolved significantly, and played a key role in drawing up the return-to-work protocols after the various Covid-19 lockdowns. It is likely to also provide a forum for key talks on the Government‚Äôs controversial plans for some form of ‚Äúrecognition‚Äù for workers for their role during the pandemic. Unchanged The trade union movement itself would appear to have emerged relatively unscathed from the past 18 months of the pandemic in terms of workers it represents. Ictu is made up of about 45 affiliate organisations which collectively represent just under 800,000 workers across the island of Ireland. It is understood that while numbers in some unions fell slightly during the pandemic, there was a corresponding increase in others, leaving the total relatively unchanged since the last Ictu conference in 2018. However the movement also faces challenges in a number of areas. Earlier this year Kevin Callinan, the head of the trade union F√≥rsa and the incoming Ictu president, warned it needed to make itself relevant to tens of thousands of workers in the technology and pharmaceutical sectors, as well as the gig economy who had to an extent been effectively ignored. He also urged that the unions needed to ‚Äúget serious‚Äù about implementing internal structural reform plans drawn up nearly a decade ago. ‚ÄúAt the core of the report was the view that we should move to a much smaller number of sectoral unions, and that we should pool resources as far as possible. I want to initiate a fresh attempt to put these exhortations into practice. We know that avoiding them is not making us any stronger.‚Äù One of the key examples of this rationalisation plan in action was the establishment of F√≥rsa which came about from the amalgamation of three public and civil service unions and is now the largest representative organisation in the State sector with close to 90,000 members. However, progress elsewhere has been slow, and recent acrimony between teaching unions would suggest that in some areas rather than moving closer together divisions between organisations are deeper than ever.

While there have been some torrid times for the trade union movement over the past 12 years or so, when Ictu meets in conference in Belfast this week it will do so in a more positive environment than in a considerable period of time. Covid-19 transformed the world of work again. It led to work practice reforms and flexibilities that would have proved impossible to achieve or at the very least involved years of tortuous negotiations. Hundreds of thousands of workers left their offices and embraced technology to continue doing their jobs. State employees were redeployed to different roles virtually overnight, while health service personnel left the public system to provide services in private sector nursing homes, as did Defence Force members. However, the pandemic has also led to a major change in the attitude of Government to the world of work and to workers‚Äô rights. In a series of speeches over recent months T√°naiste Leo Varadkar has argued that one of the legacies of the pandemic must be better terms and conditions. In sentiments that could have been articulated by David Begg, Jack O‚ÄôConnor, Patricia King or many of the main trade union leaders over recent years, he has backed a move to a living wage, the need for access to an occupational pension, the right to disconnect from work, the right to seek remote working arrangements and for new legislation for statutory sick pay arrangements. However, for the unions the big announcement by Varadkar was the establishment of a high-level group to look at collective bargaining and industrial relations. Traditionally Ireland has followed what is known as a voluntarist system of industrial relations. Workers had a constitutional right to join a trade union. However, employers equally had a right not to recognise or engage with trade unions. The new review group is looking at the issue of trade union recognition and its implications for collective bargaining, as well as considering any legal or constitutional issues. Unions had been campaigning for years for collective bargaining rights but there seemed little appetite for change on the part of successive governments. Whether anything substantial emerges from the new process remains to be seen. However, for the unions getting the Government into a space where it would establish a group to look at potential reforms in this area represented a step forward. Some observers have questioned the motivation of Varadkar, and wondered if he has an eye on closing off potential avenues of political attack from Sinn F√©in, which has championed workers‚Äô rights for many years. However, unions are likely to watch carefully to see the tangible benefits on the ground from the various measures, particularly for the more vulnerable groups of workers in the private sector. The conference this week is likely to hear about the role Ictu played as the voice for all workers during the pandemic, not just those represented by a trade union. A lot of this work was carried out under the auspices of the Labour Employer Economic Forum. The LEEF, as it is known, was considered a dim echo of social partnership and provided a vehicle role for employers, unions and the Government to discuss issues such as competitiveness, job-creation and labour market standards. However, during Covid-19 it evolved significantly, and played a key role in drawing up the return-to-work protocols after the various Covid-19 lockdowns. It is likely to also provide a forum for key talks on the Government‚Äôs controversial plans for some form of ‚Äúrecognition‚Äù for workers for their role during the pandemic. The trade union movement itself would appear to have emerged relatively unscathed from the past 18 months of the pandemic in terms of workers it represents. Ictu is made up of about 45 affiliate organisations which collectively represent just under 800,000 workers across the island of Ireland. It is understood that while numbers in some unions fell slightly during the pandemic, there was a corresponding increase in others, leaving the total relatively unchanged since the last Ictu conference in 2018. However the movement also faces challenges in a number of areas. Earlier this year Kevin Callinan, the head of the trade union F√≥rsa and the incoming Ictu president, warned it needed to make itself relevant to tens of thousands of workers in the technology and pharmaceutical sectors, as well as the gig economy who had to an extent been effectively ignored. He also urged that the unions needed to ‚Äúget serious‚Äù about implementing internal structural reform plans drawn up nearly a decade ago. ‚ÄúAt the core of the report was the view that we should move to a much smaller number of sectoral unions, and that we should pool resources as far as possible. I want to initiate a fresh attempt to put these exhortations into practice. We know that avoiding them is not making us any stronger.‚Äù One of the key examples of this rationalisation plan in action was the establishment of F√≥rsa which came about from the amalgamation of three public and civil service unions and is now the largest representative organisation in the State sector with close to 90,000 members. However, progress elsewhere has been slow, and recent acrimony between teaching unions would suggest that in some areas rather than moving closer together divisions between organisations are deeper than ever.

Perhaps in honor of the recent fad accounting unusual behaviors to Mercury being in retrograde, Salt Lake County‚Äôs Department of Health dug in to some similarly ‚Äúvalid‚Äù data sets: health choices based on zodiac signs. This week‚Äôs Salt Lake Tribune reported that Leos (born between July 22 and August 21) had far and away the highest vaccination rates at 70%, while Scorpios (born between October 22 and November 21) had the lowest at 46%. This was based on extracted de-identified birthday data of vaccinated individuals in the county. The Salt Lake Health Twitter feed shared a tweet with some ‚Äústellar‚Äù data: Before we dive in to the fluff, which, according to county officials, this was, some background on Salt Lake County. With a population of 1.18 million, they have seen a total of 191,898 coronavirus cases and 1,136 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. They continue to see approximately 500 new cases daily, and have not yet turned the corner on the delta variant surge we began to experience this past summer. Nearly 680,000 county residents are fully vaccinated, or approximately 57% of the county‚Äôs population. This is slightly higher than the general population of the state of Utah , which clocks in at about 53% fully vaccinated individuals. Now back to the fluff, which hopefully will be a welcome of levity to those suffering from ‚ÄúCovid data fatigue‚Äù, as described by the Salt Lake County officials. First of all, the authors acknowledge that there are fewer residents with birthdays falling within the sign of Leo than those with Scorpion birthdays. Therefore, we would expect to see relatively higher percentages in smaller population groups. This essentially invalidates their statistics, but no matter. We‚Äôll blame it on Mercury‚Äôs retrograde shadow, as it‚Äôs all in the stars for them.

He used the idea that the cut-off date to play hockey as a child in Canada was January 1st. So players born in January-May would have a jump start on their peers born in September-December because they would enter hockey lessons nearly a year older than their peers. Being six to twelve months older than their younger teammates could make a world of difference in childhood sports competitions. Indeed, searching years of National Hockey League (and European soccer, and United States baseball for the matter) players showed a preponderance of early-in-the-year birthdays. There has since been some widening variation in this theory, possibly due to an increased interest in parents wishing to give their kids an extra year before hitting the ice (or turf).

Calls for the reintroduction of masks, social distancing and working from home continued over the weekend , but ministers have so far shown no sign of doing so despite fears over the pressure on hospitals. Instead, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has been leading calls for people to once again get jabbed in the hope that boosting the population's immunity levels will see infections drop off. The two million invites going out from today will be sent by letters, emails, and text messages, and anyone who is contacted is urged to get their booster as soon as possible. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player After a record-setting few days for the booster programme, with five million people having now received a booster since the campaign began last month, it's hoped major progress will be made over half-term. Around 7.5 million people have already been invited by text, email, and letter encouraging them to book through the National Booking Service, NHS England said. The health service is following guidance that boosters should be given at least six months after the second dose, with current evidence suggesting it is the best time to increase immunity to COVID.

Who can get a coronavirus booster jab - and when you can book NHS medical director Professor Stephen Powis urged people to get their jabs. ""Winter is coming and infection rates are rising and so it's now really important that everyone receiving their invite for a booster vaccine from the NHS this week books in at one of the convenient vaccinations sites around the country offering this crucial, additional protection,"" he said. ""Thanks to NHS staff, nine in 10 people have had a first dose, saving tens of thousands of lives, and now more than five million boosters have been delivered in the first month of the rollout. ""I would urge anyone receiving an invite this week to book in as soon as possible - the booster dose is proven to significantly increase protection against COVID and will provide vital protection this winter."" Also from Monday, just over 2.5 million letters will arrive with parents and guardians inviting them to book a jab online through the National Booking Service. There are almost 100 sites offering jabs to children aged 12 to 15, with hundreds more expected to join them in the coming weeks. Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and deputy lead for the NHS vaccine programme, said she would urge families to ""book in to give children and their loved ones crucial protection ahead of winter"". Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player However, Professor Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), warned the vaccination programme will not be enough to bring infection numbers under control. He said while vaccines are effective at stopping people from getting seriously ill, they are not as effective at stopping infections altogether or halting the spread of the virus. ""They do have an effect on that, but they're not by themselves going to be enough at the present time to keep the spread of the virus under control,"" he told Sky News. ""And we do need to see people continuing to make efforts to avoid contact, to avoid transmission, and to do other things as well as get vaccinated if we're going to stop this rise from going up further."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Prof Finn added: ""I would like to re-emphasise the fact that the vaccine programme by itself, in the current situation, even if things go optimally, is not, in my opinion, enough to bring things under control.

Addiction charities say State bodies not committing to funding,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/addiction-charities-say-state-bodies-not-committing-to-funding-1.4709536?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"A charity providing addiction services has closed and a second one is at risk of collapse due to what they say is a lack of funding commitment from State bodies. Volunteer group Family Addiction Support Network (FASN) helped 250 families across four counties in the northeast last year but it is surviving on annual funding of ‚Ç¨7,500. Jackie McKenna, who cofounded the charity more than 20 years ago, said it would be ‚Äúno longer feasible to operate on so little‚Äù. Another service, RASP, a community addiction rehabilitation service in Dublin North East ‚Äì where addiction has worsened in recent years ‚Äì used to see a minimum of 25 people come through its doors on an average day. However, after 18 months of a ‚Äúcrippling financial review‚Äù conducted by its primary funder, the Department of Education, it was ‚Äúleft with no choice but to close‚Äù, last December, its former general manager Pat Hanna told The Irish Times. Funding of ‚Ç¨170,000 annually kept the service afloat, allowing it to offer therapy to clients, as well as level six ‚Äì or post-Leaving Cert ‚Äì classes in counselling, horticulture, literacy support, and kitchen and washing facilities. Uncertainty ‚ÄúWe were very much a one-stop-shop, from therapy needs to vocational needs, and we were busy. But then we got notice that we were going under review,‚Äù Mr Hanna said. ‚ÄúThere was never any financial issue. We had three audits a year showing that. Initially, the review was supposed to take three months. Then it went on for a year and then a year and a half.‚Äù That uncertainty ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt please the banks or the staff, because we weren‚Äôt sure whether we‚Äôd definitely have funding coming in at the end of the year‚Äù, he said. Workers became unhappy with the lack of job security, and talks about shifting the charity to being funded under HSE addiction services ‚Äúnever materialised‚Äù. The fog of the Covid-19 crisis didn‚Äôt help with the delays. ‚ÄúNobody cared because the pandemic was so all-consuming, and then we just became untenable. It was a death by a thousand cuts,‚Äù he said. At a time when the rates of addiction have grown in the area, the closure of the service was a major blow to its users. ‚ÄúIt was re-traumatising for them. People presented to us with issues that had their roots in family disruption, so we really were re-traumatising them by closing. Knowing that was heartbreaking,‚Äù Mr Hanna said. ‚ÄúEverybody was referred to other services, but it was sad the way it went; ‚Ç¨170,000 was what it was about at the end of the day. When you think of the size of the HSE and Department of Education‚Äôs purse, it seems incredulous.‚Äù A spokeswoman for the Department of Education said its funding for RASP was approved annually, following an annual application process, and in 2019 the department advised the organisation it was ‚Äúplanning a review of funding of the project as one of a number of grants planned for inclusion in the review exercise‚Äù. It was originally intended to complete the review before April 2020 but this ‚Äúwas not possible‚Äù due to Covid-19 restrictions. It remained open to the service to apply for funding for 2021, but the department was informed in August 2020 of the organisation‚Äôs decision to close, the spokeswoman said. A spokeswoman for the HSE said local drugs taskforce funding of ‚Ç¨52,000 which had previously been assigned to RASP had since been transferred to the Dales addiction service in Darndale. ‚ÄòNo commitment‚Äô At the Co Louth-based FASN project, Ms McKenna said: ‚ÄúDrug violence and debt intimidating is increasing here, and the breakdown of family relationships is increasing. But there is no firm commitment to core funding for us, no timeframe on it, and we‚Äôve just been left hanging.‚Äù FASN operates on a unique model of peer-led family support and has asked the HSE for an additional ‚Ç¨138,000 to maintain the services it is currently providing. ‚ÄúThere is a huge stigma attached to drug users and families of drug users. When people come into us, they start to take control back of their own lives,‚Äù Ms McKenna said.

Keltoi, located at St Mary‚Äôs Hospital in Phoenix Park, Dublin, hit the headlines when two service users died soon after its closure. Minister for health at the time Simon Harris said it was intended that the service would be reopened for addiction support, but the HSE said Keltoi would continue to be maintained as a Covid-19 isolation facility for the coming winter period.

New Zealand‚Äôs 90% vaccination target may hinge on swaying gang members,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/new-zealand-s-90-vaccination-target-may-hinge-on-swaying-gang-members-1.4709580?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"Rawiri Jansen, a Maori doctor, has an urgent message for the 150 people, mostly patch-wearing members of New Zealand‚Äôs plentiful street gangs and their families, who sit before him on a bright Saturday afternoon. Covid is coming for them, he says. Cases in New Zealand‚Äôs hospitals are rising rapidly. Soon, dozens of new infections a day might be hundreds or even 1,000. People will die. And vaccination is the only defence. ‚ÄúWhen your doctors are scared, you should be scared,‚Äù he says. By the end of the day, after an exhaustive question-and-answer session with other health professionals, roughly one-third of those present choose to receive a dose then and there. Having abandoned its highly successful ‚Äúzero Covid‚Äù elimination strategy in response to an outbreak of the Delta variant, New Zealand is now undergoing a difficult transition to trying to keep coronavirus cases as low as possible. Last Friday the country set a target of getting at least 90 per cent of the eligible population fully vaccinated ‚Äì a goal, the highest in the developed world, whose success hinges on persuading people such as those who gather to hear Jansen. Already, 86 per cent of the eligible population has received at least one dose. But the final few per cent are the most difficult to reach, and one group of particular concern is the gang community, many of whose members are Maori or Pacific Islanders, who make up about a quarter of the overall population. In the past two months, multiple outbreaks have been reported among gangs, a group less likely to comply with official vaccination efforts, forcing officials to co-operate with gang leaders to reach their communities. New Zealand has one of the highest rates of gang membership in the world. There are about 8,000 gang members in the country, according to the most recent police estimates, and many suffer from urban poverty. Counting family and associates, the size of the community might be 10 times that, in a country of five million people, says Jarrod Gilbert, a sociologist at the University of Canterbury and the author of Patched: The History of Gangs in New Zealand. Nuanced picture New Zealand‚Äôs gangs have a long history, often inspired by similar American groups. In 1961 it became the first country outside the United States to have a chapter of the Hells Angels. Beginning in the 1970s, gangs with an ethnic basis, including the majority-Maori Black Power and Mongrel Mob, became more widespread. For Maori who had moved to New Zealand‚Äôs urban centres, gangs became a critical way to find kinship away from traditional tribal structures. More recently, Gilbert says, some have been drawn to gangs for their association with profit-driven crime, particularly the sale of drugs. New Zealand is a lucrative market for methamphetamine, and gang members have been among those caught in major police stings. Volunteers hold signs during the Pasifika Youth Vax Festival at Cannons Creek Cage in Porirua, New Zealand. Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/Getty The link between gangs and organised crime, however, is not wholly straightforward, says Gilbert. ‚ÄúNew Zealanders tend to look at the gangs with a single lens around criminality, whereas the scene is and always has been far more nuanced than that,‚Äù he says. Even within a single gang, he adds, some chapters might be highly criminalised, while others are more community-focused. Since the 1960s, New Zealand politicians have sought to score points by promising to crack down on gangs or by publicly criticising them. Attempts to engage with the gangs have tended to generate pearl-clutching headlines; a government grant of NZ$2.75 million (‚Ç¨1.7 million) to a drug rehabilitation programme connected to members of the Mongrel Mob was intensely criticised, including by police leaders. But during the current coronavirus outbreak, the police and the health ministry have worked with gangs to help with vaccination outreach and contact tracing. Two Mongrel Mob leaders, Harry Tam and Sonny Fatupaito, were given ‚Äúcritical worker‚Äù border exemption passes, allowing them to cross from one region to another. Since then, social organisations with an existing relationship with both the New Zealand government and with gangs and other marginalised groups have been deputised as emissaries to these hard-to-reach communities. They have been given grants to help bring people together to get vaccinated. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt traditionally have ways to connect with them,‚Äù says Gerardine Clifford-Lidstone, New Zealand‚Äôs director of Pacific health, of the gangs. ‚ÄúAnd by finding the people that can and giving them the information, you‚Äôve got a much higher chance of being successful.‚Äù Building bridges A social change organisation called the Cause Collective is one of the groups that has helped build the bridges. ‚ÄúHealth officials now realise, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt really know the communities, the hard-to-reach communities,‚Äô so they need professionals in those areas,‚Äù says hip-hop producer Danny Leaosavai‚Äôi, also known as Brotha D, who works with the organisation and has a long-standing connection to gang leaders. Chris Hipkins, the minister responsible for New Zealand‚Äôs Covid-19 response, acknowledged earlier this month that the decision to enlist gang leaders was an unusual one. ‚ÄúOur number one priority here is to stop Covid-19 in its tracks, and that means doing what we need to do to get in front of the virus,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhere we have been able to enlist gang leaders to help with that and where they have been willing to do so, we have done that.‚Äù Some gang leaders have acted independently to help the vaccination effort. They have connected members of their community to health officials, organised events with health professionals such as Jansen, and streamed events on Facebook Live to allow an open forum for questions about rare health risks. In some cases, they have taken vaccines to communities themselves. ‚ÄúOur community is probably less well-informed; they‚Äôre probably not as health literate,‚Äù says Tam, the Mongrel Mob member, who is a former civil servant and who received the border exemption. Constant media criticism has turned them off from reading traditional news outlets, he adds. ‚ÄúThey then resort to social media, because they have much greater control,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also a space that perpetuates conspiracy theories and false information and all the rest of it.‚Äù Health advice has to come from trusted individuals and leaders in the community, he says. In the past week Tam has travelled almost the length of the country organising pop-up vaccination events for members and their communities as well as co-ordinating with other chapter leaders to get their members vaccinated, he says. It is difficult work that has put him at personal risk, he says, and that invites intense scepticism from people who think of gangs only as violent or connected to organised crime. ‚ÄúWhy do we bother?‚Äù Tam said. ‚ÄúWe bother because we care about those people that others don‚Äôt care about, as simple as that. They can talk about my gang affiliation, all the rest of it. But it‚Äôs that affiliation that allows me to have that penetration, that foot in the door. I can do the stuff that they can‚Äôt do.‚Äù ‚Äì This article originally appeared in The New York Times",,10/25/21 0:00,"Rawiri Jansen , a Maori doctor, has an urgent message for the 150 people, mostly patch-wearing members of New Zealand‚Äôs plentiful street gangs and their families, who sit before him on a bright Saturday afternoon.

My choice‚Äù and ‚ÄúEqual rights for unvaxxed‚Äù. Before the start of this season, the team informed the point guard he would not be allowed to practice with the team or play at Barclays because of his refusal to get a COVID-19 vaccine. ‚ÄúKyrie has made a personal choice, and we respect his individual right to choose,‚Äù the team said in a statement at the time. ‚ÄúCurrently the choice restricts his ability to be a full-time member of the team, and we will not permit any member of our team to participate with part-time availability,‚Äù the statement said. Irving, 29, joined Brooklyn in 2019 and helped lead the team into the playoffs last season before missing playing time against the Milwaukee Bucks due to injury. The Nets went on to lose the game 111-95 in a massive upset. Kobe Bryant‚Äôs widow is suing over a series of photographs taken on the day of the basketball legend‚Äôs death.

Supporters of paid sick leave in B.C. advocate from Vancouver and Victoria,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2021/10/24/vancouver-victoria-paid-sick-leave/,,['alylaube'],,People in Vancouver and Victoria who want B.C. to give workers 10 paid sick days took to the streets Monday to rally for action from the Horgan government.,"A so-called ‚ÄúCOVID-safe Day of Action‚Äù is taking place Monday in Metro Vancouver and Victoria, with groups hoping to pressure the Horgan government to follow through with its plans to bring in mandatory paid sick leave for workers. Raj Khunkhun, VP with Community Savings Credit Union, says his organization is advocating for 10 paid sick days. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre lagging behind comparable countries like New Zealand and Australia. They already introduced 10 paid sick days. Germany actually has 30,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe federal government is poised to bring in 10 paid sick days for federally regulated workers, so we think B.C. should introduce 10 paid sick days as well.‚Äù Related Articles: B.C. seeks input on length of paid sick leave Some B.C. businesses still resistant to paid sick leave: CFIB Health-care workers demand Trudeau fast track paid sick-leave policy The Horgan government is expected to pass legislation before the end of the year to bring in paid sick leave, despite opposition from certain groups ‚Äî including the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. But Khunkhun says having provincially-mandated paid sick days isn‚Äôt going to deter businesses. ‚ÄúWe have always provided 12 paid sick days, but we provided a further 10 paid sick days during the pandemic, very early on, and also an additional six hours a week off just to get groceries because the line-ups were long,‚Äù said Khunkhun. They found there was no impact to their bottom line and had their most profitable year to-date. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want people to have to decide between getting paid fully and putting others at risk. We don‚Äôt think that should be a burden on the worker. They should also be able to take the time off, and that will also help our healthcare system, which is already really stressed right now,‚Äù added Khunkhun.",10/25/21 0:59,,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/9/2021/01/sneeze-1431371.jpg,citynews1130

A ccording to two of the country‚Äôs leading paranormal investigation groups, Ireland ranks among the highest in the world for paranormal activity. Some of Ireland‚Äôs spookiest sites include Kilmainhan Gaol in Dublin, Loftus Hall in Wexford, Ross Castle in Meath and Spike Island in Cork, as well as Charleville and Leap Castles in Offaly. Paranormal investigators consider that, on a per capita basis, Offaly ranks as the most haunted county in Ireland. Irish Paranormal Investigations (IPI) official Ann Massey said reports of increased activity had included a surging number of contacts from the public about unexplained occurrences in people‚Äôs homes, not just known haunted houses and castles. Read More ‚ÄòHospitals are at full tilt‚Äô: Urgent demand to give health workers the booster jab It is believed the traumatic impact on society of the world‚Äôs worst pandemic since the 1918 Spanish Flu has somehow heightened contacts between the living and spirit worlds. Ms Massey said such ‚Äòstep-over‚Äô activity between the human and spirit worlds was common in times of societal trauma such as wars and pandemics. ‚ÄúFrom our perspective as a group we have been getting a lot more contact from people ‚Äì especially in their private houses,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt is twofold ‚Äì more people are more aware of what is going on around them now and noticing these step-overs from the spirit realm.

The IPI team includes Ms Massey, Dominic McElroy, Liam Canty and up to three others. Their investigations range from measuring physical, electrical and temperature changes through to examining the history and even archaeology of an area. Most haunted houses have exploited their paranormal legends with successful commercial offerings ranging from ghost tours to Halloween parties. Leap Castle even offers a special evening meal dubbed ‚ÄòDining with the Dead‚Äô. However, the most feared site in Ireland is the Hellfire Club located at Montpelier Hill in Dublin. Built as a hunting lodge, legend has it the structure disturbed an ancient burial site ‚Äì and has been troubled by angry spirits ever since. But its dark reputation dates from the mid-18th century when it was rumoured to have been used by the Hellfire Club, a group of dissolute nobles, for parties. Such was the behaviour of the group that it was even rumoured the building hosted ‚Äòblack masses‚Äô ‚Äì and that at each dinner a chair was deliberately left empty in case Satan decided to attend. Ms Massey said paranormal activity noted at the Hellfire Club had even extended to the estate grounds and woods. She said such was Ireland‚Äôs rich folklore history that almost every part of the country had stories of hauntings and supernatural activity. ‚ÄúJust like history has layers, so does supernatural activity,‚Äù she said. Ms Massey said her favourite investigation sites in Ireland were Dundrum, Tipperary and Cork‚Äôs Spike Island. ‚ÄúPrisons are places where there can be a lot of paranormal activity,‚Äù she said. Co-founder of Paranormal Supernatural Investigations Ireland (PSI), Richard Morrison (42), said Ireland was noted on an international scale for its residual energy and paranormal activity. ‚ÄúI think Ireland is up there in the top two at least, even as paranormal researchers we‚Äôre amazed. ‚ÄúWe find that 95pc of the evidence that we capture is after the investigation from our appointment that‚Äôs gathered the evidence. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very rarely something will happen visually, it‚Äôs our equipment that‚Äôs capturing all this. Ireland has a lot of history and the energy here is very active for paranormal researching. ‚ÄúWe believe the whole land itself has got a lot of residual energy,‚Äù he said. Mr Morrison said the group preferred not to be referred to as ‚Äòghost hunters‚Äô; he said they researched locations that they believed had residual energy. ‚ÄúWe research an area, analyse our evidence and see if we can back up any of the claims that the place is spiritually haunted,‚Äù he said. Mr Morrison has had personal experiences with paranormal activity since he was a young child. ‚ÄúMy great-grandfather passed away during an operation. I always remember I asked, ‚ÄòWould you ever visit me, Granddad, if you died?‚Äô and his exact words were, ‚ÄòOf course I‚Äôd come and visit you‚Äô. ‚ÄúHe went in for a routine operation and he sadly passed away. A few nights after his death I woke up and for some reason my head was drawn to my bedside table, I remember seeing this luminous green outline of a person and I got the feeling that I knew that was my grandfather. ‚ÄúI was only six. Children are very open, they have their third eye and they‚Äôre very spiritually connected. ‚ÄúThey can see things that maybe adults can‚Äôt see and as we get older, we tend to close that spiritual side of us. The second night that same incident happened again. ‚ÄúThen, when I was 15 I saw the same figure was standing at the bottom of my bed. I ran into my parents‚Äô bedroom and told them. ‚ÄúMy parents always told me it was a dream.‚Äù He went on: ‚ÄúIt is nice to share the evidence that we‚Äôve been gathering with people. Some people will always be sceptical and that‚Äôs the way human nature is. The way we work we just put the evidence out there and we let people decide for themselves.‚Äù Mr Morrison said the Galway-based group recently captured a photo of a ghostly figure in the window of Moore Hall in Co Mayo. ‚ÄúThe image is as clear as day,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no inside stairs or floors, it‚Äôs a complete shell of a house. ‚ÄúWe love to go investigate these places because we research the history of the location.‚Äù Read More ‚ÄòHospitals are at full tilt‚Äô: Urgent demand to give health workers the booster jab",https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/23eb4/40980812.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/atural%20Galway%2019543.jpg,independent

Booster shots for health workers could be justified as ‚Äòpolicy decision‚Äô,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/booster-shots-for-health-workers-could-be-justified-as-policy-decision-1.4709649?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"The Government could keep the hospitals safer this winter by giving healthcare workers a booster Covid-19 vaccine but it is not required from a scientific basis, a leading virologist has said. Dr Cillian De Gascun, a member of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac), said vaccines had adequately protected health workers from illness but the Government could decide to boost immunity to avoid the hospital system coming under further pressure during the winter. He noted that health workers were mostly young and still had effective protection from the vaccine but he pointed to recent scientific evidence showing declining vaccine effectiveness after six months and that health workers had been vaccinated in the early part of the year. ‚ÄúThe evidence isn‚Äôt there scientifically to justify boosting what is otherwise a fairly young healthy cohort ‚Äì frontline healthcare workers,‚Äù said Dr De Gascun. ‚ÄúBut, as a policy decision, if you know that vaccine effectiveness is falling off, I don‚Äôt think it would be unreasonable for the HSE or the Government or the Department [of Health] to decide that actually we can‚Äôt have a risk of the healthcare system coming under massive pressure.‚Äù Hospital outbreaks where patients were getting infected by staff or staff are being forced out of work could put significant pressure on the hospital system over winter. ‚ÄúYou could make a justifiable policy-based decision that in order to maintain or protect the healthcare system over the course of the winter that it would be prudent to vaccinate frontline healthcare workers,‚Äù he said. The director of UCD‚Äôs National Virus Reference Laboratory, a member of the National Public Health Emergency Team, stressed that he was speaking in a personal capacity and not on behalf of Niac, which is still considering whether to extend boosters to health staff. The HSE has been providing third booster jabs to people aged over 80 in the community and individuals aged 65 and over in care homes and other long-term residential care facilities. It is also extending the booster programme to 800,000 people aged between 60 and 80 and people who have compromised immune systems. Niac is coming under pressure to extend the rollout to health workers as HSE chief executive Paul Reid warned that the number of health workers out sick could soon rise to 2,000. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has written to the State‚Äôs chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan and the chair of Niac calling on boosters to be given to frontline health workers. The representative group pointed to the increase in Covid-19 infections among healthcare workers with nurses and midwives the most infected, accounting for more than 26 per cent of all health worker infections.

Read Full Article at RT.com,"A renown Australian cartoonist has said he lost his prime spot at a Melbourne-based newspaper after he drew parallels between the Tiananmen square protests and Covid-19 vaccine mandates in a new cartoon. Cartoonist Michael Leunig, sometimes referred to as Australia‚Äôs ‚Äúliving national treasure‚Äù, has revealed that he was forced out of his position at the editorial page of The Age daily newspaper after publishing a political cartoon criticizing the government‚Äôs push for mandatory vaccination. Speaking to The Australian on Monday, Leunig said that while the editorial team has censored about a dozen of his works this year, the last straw appeared to be an anti-mandate cartoon which was a play on the iconic Tank Man photo. Leunig's cartoon shows a man staring down a tank, with its main gun being replaced by a syringe. The original photo depicts a lone Chinese protester standing before a line of tanks during the 1989 pro-democracy protests at the Tiananmen square. While his cartoon was rejected by The Age, Leunig published the drawing on his Instagram, triggering backlash from the proponents of the vaccine mandates. Shortly after the controversy erupted, Leuning, who worked for the newspaper for over twenty years, was told that his services as a political cartoonist were no longer needed. The Age‚Äôs editor, Gay Alcorn, reportedly told the artist that he was ""out of touch"" with the readers before notifying him of his demotion. While Alcorn praised Leuning as ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù in a comment to The Australian, he confirmed that his works would no longer appear on the editorial page. The newspaper still plans to commision lifestyle cartoons from Leuning, however. Leuning, for his part, accused the newspaper of ‚Äúwokeism and humorlessness,‚Äù defending the cartoon as an accurate reflection of the times. ‚ÄúThe Tiananmen Square image is often used in cartoons around the world as a Charlie Chaplin-like metaphor for overwhelming force meeting the innocent powerless individual. In my view, it is a fair enough issue to raise in the most locked-down city in the world,‚Äù the cartoonist said, referring to Melbourne, which set a record for the longest cumulative Covid-19 lockdown after shutting down for 262 days.

The Samhain sorcerers ‚Äì aka Derry City and Strabane District Council ‚Äì have opened not one, not two, but five netherworlds filled with ancient spirits, digital wonders and dark, nightmarish visions. Three of these illuminated worlds will be spread across Derry city, with one in nearby Strabane and another in Buncrana, Co Donegal. Each world will feature its own programmes, including installations, large-scale inflatables, aerial acrobatics, choreographed displays and cutting-edge live music. A highlight could be Ireland‚Äôs first digital LED installation, a 360-degree yoke involving film, animation and augmented reality.

The fans have since grown up, and the bands have grown older, but everyone was in fine fettle for this nostalgia trip back in time. Now F√©ile Classical is back, and this time it‚Äôs moved indoors to the 3Arena, but the spirit of Tipp will be alive and well in the line-up of acts, which includes An Emotional Fish, The Frank and Walters, Hot House Flowers and The Four of Us. The broadcaster Tom Dunne will again curate and host the event ‚Äì and get up and sing with his band Something Happens. The 42-piece Irish Chamber Orchestra will bring the icing on the cake to such perennial Irish rock anthems as Celebrate, After All, Don‚Äôt Go, Mary and Parachute. And Irish Women in Harmony, featuring Tolu Makay, Aimee, Erica Cody, Faye O‚ÄôRourke, Eve Belle and Ailbhe Reddy, will perform 1980s and 1990s classics such as Mandinka, Linger and When Love Comes to Town.

Spleodar promises plenty of scares and spooky excitement during the midterm break, both live and online, including a radio play of Edgar Allan Poe‚Äôs Tell Tale Heart (Monday, October 25th, Tipp FM, 6pm); a Ghost Stories Trail starting at Nenagh Arts Centre and stopping off at some scary places (Friday, October 29th, Nenagh Arts Centre, 5pm, free); a virtual Music Generation Workshop where three- to six-year-olds can make music using everyday household items (Friday, October 29th, 4pm, online, free); Dracuvan, in which a certain vampire starts his own mobile blood-donor clinic (Friday, October 29th, 6pm, online, free) and a sensory-friendly screening of Roald Dahl‚Äôs The Witches, starring Anne Hathaway. F √©ile Classical Thursday, October 28th; 6.30pm; 3Arena, Dublin; ‚Ç¨34.90; ticketmaster.ie In 2018 some of Ireland‚Äôs most popular bands of the 1990s reconvened at Semple Stadium, in Thurles, to relive the heady days of F√©ile, when Ireland‚Äôs youth made the Trip to Tipp for a weekend of carousing, drinking, snogging and moshing. The fans have since grown up, and the bands have grown older, but everyone was in fine fettle for this nostalgia trip back in time. Now F√©ile Classical is back, and this time it‚Äôs moved indoors to the 3Arena, but the spirit of Tipp will be alive and well in the line-up of acts, which includes An Emotional Fish, The Frank and Walters, Hot House Flowers and The Four of Us. The broadcaster Tom Dunne will again curate and host the event ‚Äì and get up and sing with his band Something Happens. The 42-piece Irish Chamber Orchestra will bring the icing on the cake to such perennial Irish rock anthems as Celebrate, After All, Don‚Äôt Go, Mary and Parachute. And Irish Women in Harmony, featuring Tolu Makay, Aimee, Erica Cody, Faye O‚ÄôRourke, Eve Belle and Ailbhe Reddy, will perform 1980s and 1990s classics such as Mandinka, Linger and When Love Comes to Town. Of course you still remember all the words. Sligo Live: The Coronas Saturday, October 30th; Knocknarea Arena, IT Sligo, 8pm; ‚Ç¨42.50 plus fees; sligolive.ie The Coronas were a bit put out when Covid-19 hit ‚Äì they weren‚Äôt too keen on sharing their name with the virus that‚Äôs upturned everyone‚Äôs lives. Most bands dream of going viral, but not like that. The Dublin three-piece decided to carry on regardless, releasing their latest album, True Love Waits, in the teeth of the pandemic and going straight to number one. Now they‚Äôre embarking on a tour that rocks up at Knocknarea Arena on Saturday as part of Sligo Live. Support is from the singer Danny O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs similarly talented sis, R√≥is√≠n O.

Flannery‚Äôs self-titled debut album was shortlisted for a Choice prize for album of the year, while O‚ÄôNeill, who also works under the acronym Son, has toured with Sharon Shannon. The duo have released a fine collaborative album, In the Game, and are playing two shows at the Hawk‚Äôs Well, as part of Sligo Live, that promise to be both intimate and inspiring.",https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4705788.1634740258!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg,irishtimes

Two musicians who‚Äôve taken the spark they felt in March 2020, when they met in person for the one and only time, and fanned it into a flame that‚Äôs fuelled nine recordings since then, described as ‚Äúa year documented in sound and art‚Äù, with three more to come before the year‚Äôs end. Both musicians have a rich history in collaboration and in seeking out the liminal spaces where intriguing things can happen. Cannell is a composer, recorder player and violinist with a penchant for mining ancient, improvised and new music. Her musical identities are many, and include writing for film under the name of Isobel Raven. She‚Äôs almost finished recording a bass recorder album titled Antiphony of the Trees, an exploration of birdsong in her native Suffolk. And next summer, she will release an electronic synth album, Destruction Horizon, under the name of Huntress, ‚Äúexploring the idea that this current period in time is our destruction horizon, and we will be able to look back at it at some point, but at the moment we are inside it‚Äù. Kate Ellis is a cellist and musical director of Crash Ensemble. She‚Äôs also a member of Martin Hayes‚Äôs Common Ground Ensemble, as well as Yurodny, Taquin Experiments (with Francesco Turrisi) and the multimedia co-operative RESOUND. Both musicians draw on multiple sources of influence, from traditional and folk music to classical, minimalism and improvisational impulses. Cannell and Ellis are clearly hardworking, curious musicians whose first collaboration, These Feral Lands Volume 1, was released in November of last year on Brawl Records. Theirs was a twilight world full of emotional dissonance and utterly in sync with Covid time. A month later, the pair released a Christmas EP titled Winter Rituals. And in January, with a performance-free calendar looming, they embarked on a major collaboration: These Feral Lands: January Sounds was the first of a suite of 12 monthly CDs, released on the last Friday of each month, each one featuring new music recorded that month, and capturing how they felt in that time, with all of the strangeness and oddity that being an artist and living through lockdowns, online performance and social distancing entails. Laura Cannell: ‚ÄòCollaborating with Kate has definitely been a lifeline. Having someone who I can have a real musical conversation with‚Äô It‚Äôs a rich and intense work output from a pair who‚Äôve only met in person once. But Cannell lives in Suffolk, and Ellis is originally from Essex, so perhaps their shared geographical heritage has played into the fluidity of their partnership? Cannell sees it differently. ‚ÄúI just think that we live in such musically similar places but geographically I don‚Äôt know anything about the Irish music scene at all,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut collaborating with Kate has definitely been a lifeline. Having someone who I can have a real musical conversation with. It‚Äôs a big relief every month, a feeling of ‚Äònow, I can just be me‚Äô.‚Äù Visceral For Ellis too, the connection feels more visceral and intuitive than most of the more usual and highly diverse professional collaborations she enjoys. ‚ÄúThe way that we both talk musically is the key,‚Äù she says, smiling. ‚ÄúWe understand one another‚Äôs musical language so we don‚Äôt have to explain ourselves to one another ‚Äì and that, for both of us, is huge. What I find is that the less talking we do, the better. We just play and see what happens.‚Äù What began in These Feral Lands Vol 1 with a desire on Cannell‚Äôs part to ‚Äúrevoice animals through instruments‚Äù has evolved organically into something that‚Äôs all-encompassing, wrapping the listener in a sheath that seems to both deflect and reflect the uncertainty of the times we are living through, capturing the often disquieting waxing and waning of the year with pinprick precision. Many of these monthly releases feature Cannell and Ellis alone, while others include guest musicians and artists. But at their core is this ineffably grounded and spacious presence that is Cannell and Ellis. ‚ÄúThis is a very personal, very open but very specific project,‚Äù Ellis offers. ‚ÄúWhen we‚Äôve approached collaborators [including comedian Stewart Lee, musician Adrian Crowley and visual artists Laura Sheeran and Rory Tangney] we‚Äôve left it wide open for them to contribute whatever they choose.

I think I‚Äôll be able to judge it more clearly after a little more time has passed ‚Äì maybe next year. Musically, though, I can hear a honing-in, and an exploring, always an exploring.‚Äù For Cannell, it‚Äôs the back-and-forth between them that resonates most. ‚ÄúListening through from January to October, I feel like we‚Äôre co-composing,‚Äù she muses. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre parallel and then intertwining. We‚Äôve developed our own sound. I still feel very emotional about it, to be honest. The recordings feel very raw, back in January and February, but I can hear how we were in a strange place of overwhelmedness and grieving and all sorts of different things.

What started out as a streaming project has morphed into limited-edition CDs being released monthly (some with accompanying videos and other visuals), and almost all of their releases have sold out. Clearly, Cannell and Ellis are hitting the mark. ‚ÄúPeople tell us that they really need this,‚Äù Cannell says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing to realise that what we‚Äôre offering means so much to some people. I really love performing and I really do feel like it‚Äôs where my communication is at its best. It‚Äôs so important but realising that other people appreciate it, and need it ‚Äì it‚Äôs not frivolous and really means something to other people and to us.

Stephen Kenny‚Äôs Ireland on the cusp of recapturing public imagination,https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/stephen-kenny-s-ireland-on-the-cusp-of-recapturing-public-imagination-1.4709323?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"Just how fickle football can be is underlined by this new feel-good factor surrounding the Irish men‚Äôs team. From widespread handwringing not so long ago, a couple of victories have rejuvenated belief in both the side and its manager, Stephen Kenny. Ireland, it seems, is back in the results business. That the substance of those two results is debatable doesn‚Äôt seem to matter. An away win in Azerbaijan, the 119th ranked team in the world, as well as a 4-0 friendly thrashing of Qatar in Dublin hardly represent earth-shattering form - although it has at least boosted Kenny‚Äôs previous dismal statistical record of a single win against the microstate of Andorra in 16 matches. Almost as important as the two results, though, has been the method behind them. It has helped set a new mood-music. Modern Irish football history has been dominated by the perennial style versus substance debate. Here at least has been some evidence that the two are not incompatible. Whether it is simply relief at the novelty of winning again, or reassurance at the sight of Irish players stringing passes together to people they know, the Irish football public does appear to have pounced on the positive spirit with a fervour that reflects how downcast expectations had become. Such a reaction inevitably provokes corresponding dangers of inflating presumptions to an unreasonable degree. On the back of a couple of games some players who had been previously maligned are now getting reviews that flirt with being rave. Managing to dominate the Qatari midfield has morphed Jeff Hendrick from relative anonymity to potential dynamo of Newcastle‚Äôs new order: Callum Robinson isn‚Äôt some pampered second-rater but a free-spirited goal machine waiting to escape from championship level at West Brom. If the mundane reality in both cases is more middle-of-the-road, only the truly negative will insist on cocking a snoot at a rare injection of optimism into the atmosphere surrounding the national team‚Äôs fortunes.

Having come through a bruising crash-course in how volatile the public tenor can be, those last two victories appear to have made a new contract something that‚Äôs Kenny‚Äôs to lose in Ireland‚Äôs final couple of World Cup qualifying group games. Overpowering the Azeris and Qataris might have been technically meaningless but their political value is stamped all over Kenny‚Äôs boosted status and Irish football‚Äôs new frame of mind. Should it sustain through next month‚Äôs matches against Portugal and Luxembourg then Kenny‚Äôs signature is assured as he targets qualification for Euro 2024. It could also provoke the commercial world into measuring that intangible element called popular sentiment. Such have been the doldrums that the senior men‚Äôs team has sunk to that it doesn‚Äôt have a sponsor. It has been almost two years since the ‚ÄòThree‚Äô deal finished up. Since then the FAI has put a lot of work into replacing them but without success. That‚Äôs a stark bottom-line verdict from the business world. Advertising works on association. And the commercial market has bluntly decided it doesn‚Äôt want to be associated with this Ireland team. It‚Äôs not like such reluctance is hard to fathom. Years of nightmare headlines about the administration and governance of soccer in this country have taken a reputational toll. No one wants their product to conjure associations with ineptitude off the pitch and mediocrity on it. Some reports suggest that some FAI conceit at least hasn‚Äôt disappeared with an apparent value still being put on their headline sponsorship at E2.5 million per year. Several potential sponsors have baulked at that and again it‚Äôs not hard to see why. Names with proven star appeal on the pitch such as a Duff or any kind of Keane aren‚Äôt around anymore. They‚Äôre not off the pitch either. Kenny‚Äôs leadership skills don‚Äôt lend themselves to much obvious charisma. It‚Äôs also been a long time since being able to presume on qualification for major tournaments. But what these two latest wins have produced is some vital momentum. They have germinated a little hope in Irish football. Should that flower a little more against Portugal and Luxembourg then there is every chance of capturing the popular imagination in a big way. There is little the Irish football public appreciates more than a battling underdog. But this is a setup that at least aspires to be a little different in how it plays, with a manager who, whatever else might be said about him, has the courage of his convictions even when he‚Äôs the one being put under pressure. That has produced moments that have left some hard-nosed pundits wincing. But there seems to be some wider appreciation of the ambition towards a more expansive way of playing by a side where the emphasis is very much on youth. Perhaps it is that changing face that is at the heart of this new optimism. This is a representative side that is recognizably reflective of Ireland today. And it is a side that is easy to like. Both on and off the pitch there appears to be an easy confidence about the younger squad members in particular that is easy to warm to. These are players who are relatable to the next generation of soccer fans, including those from diverse heritages and backgrounds. It‚Äôs probably little wonder then that after back to back wins, and with Covid-19 restrictions lifting to allow a full house in Lansdowne for Ronaldo & Co, that the popular mood is a lot more upbeat than it was. Of course the fates may swing back again too. When the outcome of a game against Luxembourg is the measure of progress, then it is dangerous to be presumptive.

SA may soon be using new fingerprint tech ‚Äì that can capture data from 6-week-old babies,https://www.businessinsider.co.za/new-contactless-fingerprint-scanner-in-south-africa-2021-10,,['Luke Daniel'],,"Contactless biometric systems have become more important amid the global Covid-19 pandemic, and new software which recognises photographs of fingerprints has a South African market.","(Getty Images)Biometric systems analyse data according to unique human characterises, like fingerprints or facial features.And while fingerprint scanners are common biometric access tools, the Covid-19 pandemic has made continuous human contact a problem.South Africa‚Äôs Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has developed software which creates a contactless fingerprint scanning solution.It uses photographs to map fingerprints patterns, thereby avoiding the need for touch.It can also acquire ""fingerprints from babies as young as 6-weeks-old and possibly younger.""For more stories go to www.BusinessInsider.co.za.South Africa‚Äôs Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has developed contactless biometric software which detects patterns in colour photographs of fingerprints. It‚Äôs now looking to partner in both the private and public sector.Biometric systems, which analyse human features like fingerprints, faces, and voices, have advanced rapidly over the past decade. Mobile phones are unlocked through fingerprint and facial recognition, while the same applies to accessing buildings, and verifying a person's identity during registration processes. These applications all have one thing in common: the ability to identify and individual through a unique human characteristic. Biometric technology, which is constantly evolving in its precision and speed, simplifies personal identification. But using contact fingerprint scanners, arguably the most common biometric system, comes with its challenges, particularly during the time of Covid-19. These scanners need to be kept clean to ensure their optimum functionality and, within the context of a pandemic, to ensure the health and safety of all those who use it. Constant cleaning has become a laborious task and is an ineffective long-term solution. One of the answers to this problem is contactless fingerprint scanning technology, which doesn‚Äôt require any uncontrolled direct contact with the hardware. The CSIR‚Äôs VeristicPrint Biometric System is an example of this technology. ""The VeristicPrint Biometric System is a contactless fingerprint recognition software solution that enables any digital device such as a smartphone or webcam to function as a fingerprint scanner,"" Edwin Rampine, a Senior Software Engineer at the CSIR, tells Business Insider South Africa.""Simply put, [it's the] the use of a camera from a device to take a picture of your finger, then the software processes that picture to become a fingerprint that can be used as if you scanned it from a traditional fingerprint scanner. So, you get the fingerprint without 'touching' the finger.""The software can be integrated into web portals and mobile apps alike and can determine the unique pattern of a fingerprint from a photo taken with a camera with quality as low as 5MP.The CSIR issued an invitation for the expression of interest (EOI) in VeristicPrint¬†last Monday. This is a call for government departments, law enforcement and military agencies, airport services, retailers, financial institutions, and the healthcare sector to collaborate and invest in the software. In addition to limiting the spread of Covid-19, VeristicPrint is also an affordable biometric solution that does not rely on specialised hardware. The software also allows users to enrol and be verified while at home, thereby eliminating queues.Another advantage listed in the CSIR‚Äôs EOI invitation is the VeristicPrint‚Äôs ability to acquire ""fingerprints from babies as young as 6-weeks-old and possibly younger"".VeristicPrint stores this data safely, says Rampine, and can be integrated into a physical server or in the cloud. The software also allows stored fingerprints to be encrypted, further heightening data protection.""VeristicPrint has a feature that enables storing fingerprints secured in an irreversibly encrypted format [hashed], one of the other features of VeristicPrint is that it can match fingerprints in this hashed format, without the need to ‚Äòdecrypt‚Äô the stored fingerprints,"" says Rampine.""This provides inherent security, on top of other system-wide security measures that must be applied.""Parties interested in investing or deploying this technology have until today to respond to the CSIR‚Äôs EOI invitation.¬†Receive a daily news update¬†on your cellphone.

Ejin, a county in China‚Äôs Inner Mongolia region, asked its 35,700 residents to stay home from Monday and warned of civil and criminal liabilities should anyone disobey the order, state broadcaster CCTV reported, citing a local government statement. The small county bordering Mongolia is the current outbreak‚Äôs hotspot, home to nearly one-third of the more than 150 infections found over the past week in the mainland. The lockdown comes a day after a warning from National Health Commission officials that the outbreak would continue to worsen after spreading to 11 provinces in about a week. China reported 38 Covid infections on Monday, half of which were found in Inner Mongolia. The capital Beijing -- which has seen a dozen new cases traced back to the northwest -- has all but banned entry by people arriving from anyplace in the country that‚Äôs reported locally-transmitted Covid cases. People who have to visit Beijing from these areas must provide a negative Covid test conducted no longer than two days earlier, and undergo two weeks of unspecified health monitoring. Meanwhile, provinces with a handful of cases, including Beijing; Inner Mongolia, Gansu and Ningxia in the northwest; and Guizhou, in the southwest, have been banned from conducting cross-country travel tours. All train services around China related to tourism have also been halted, as the current outbreak has seen the virus spread quickly among tour groups. The escalating curbs underscore the challenge even China‚Äôs formidable Covid restrictions face in controlling the highly-contagious delta variant. The country is the only nation in the world still seeking to eliminate local transmission of the virus at a time when other so-called Covid-Zero stalwarts -- from Singapore to Australia -- have pivoted to treating it as endemic. China has managed to quash a slew of flareups since delta first breached its tight border controls in May. One in July and August eventually spread to half of China, forcing authorities to cut transport from hotspots and test local populations multiple times to bring infections back to zero -- only to see new clusters emerge.",,business-standard

"RIL Q2 Review: Analysts Say O2C, Retail Units Will Continue To Drive Earnings Growth",https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/ril-q2-review-analysts-say-o2c-retail-units-will-continue-to-drive-earnings-growth,"['Reliance Industries Ltd.', 'bqmetered']",['Sameer Bhardwaj'],,Here‚Äôs what brokerages have to say about RIL‚Äôs second-quarter results:,"Reliance Industries Ltd. reported an 11.5% sequential increase in net profit in the second quarter, helped by improved performance of its oil-to-chemical and retail segments. These two, analysts said, would be key to the company's growth.Rebound in demand across categories, as the economy opens up with easing of Covid-19 second wave restrictions, helped the retail segment. Improved realisation on an increase in oil prices, higher volumes, and better transportation fuel cracks supported the O2C segment, though partly offset by rising feedstock prices and softening of key polymer-naphtha spreads. Retail and O2C Ebitda grew 50% and 4% sequentially in the quarter ended September.The operating profit of the upstream (oil and gas) segment rose 34% sequentially to Rs 1,071 crore amid higher production from KG-D6 block and U.S. shale, and higher realisation.RIL's stock opened 2.7% higher than Friday‚Äôs close and was trading 0.24% higher as of 9.45 a.m. on Monday.Out of 36 analysts tracking the stock, 22 recommend 'buy', nine suggest a 'hold', and five have a 'sell' rating. The stock is trading above Bloomberg's consensus target price of Rs 2,586, still implying a price downside of 1.8%.Here‚Äôs what brokerages have to say about RIL‚Äôs second-quarter results:JefferiesReported in line Ebitda in retail and O2C, but missed estimates in Jio. Ebitda rose 37% year-on-year driven by a 20% rise in Jio, a 21% rise in retail, and a 42% rise in O2C.Petrochemical volumes rose 7% quarter-on-quarter on the back of strong domestic demand.China climate restrictions have cut refinery runs and tightened diesel supplies. This improves RIL's gross refining margin to $12 (calculated) now vs $7.1 in first half of FY22.Improvement in macro helped retail performance with acceleration in store additions to a multi-quarter high. Performance is broad-based, though fashion and lifestyle led the way.Jio's subscriber decline of 1.1 crore was a key disappointment. Further, increased cash expenses and low incremental Ebitda margins of 50% disappointed further.Cut consolidated earnings per share estimates marginally by 1% for FY23-24E to factor in lower subscriber estimates for Jio.There is a potential for a 10-12% upgrade to consensus estimates of O2C Ebitda if China doesn't go back on its climate goals in FY22E. Strong sequential growth is expected in retail Ebitda over second half of FY22E.Maintain 'buy' with a reduced target price of Rs 3,000 (from Rs 3,050 earlier), implying an upside price potential of 14.2%.JM FinancialPetrochemical margins were impacted due to high input cost, despite strong demand recovery.Retail business Ebitda rebounded due to the easing of lockdown restrictions and positive operating leverage.Jio‚Äôs net subscriber loss of 1.1 crores disappoint and could further push tariff hikes. A part of such subscriber loss could have been due to the impact of Jio phone users moving out after their three-year lock-in.Marginally cut FY22/FY23 Ebitda by 2.5%/0.3% due to moderation in Jio‚Äôs subscriber additions and expected delay in tariff hikes to first quarter of FY23.Refining margin improvement in the last few weeks driven by a strong recovery in global oil demand, gas to oil switching, supply outages, and resultant inventory drawdown. Reiterate 'buy' with an unchanged target price of Rs 2,800, implying an upside price potential of 6.5%.JP MorganRetail saw a meaningful quarter-on-quarter increase (Rs 2,900 crore, +50% quarter over quarter) given higher operating stores at 89% in second quarter vs 61% in first quarter, and footfalls at 78% of pre-Covid levels vs 46% in first quarter.O2C performance was supported by a sharp rally in diesel and jet cracks and the segment is expected to further improve in second half driven by refining. Exploration and production was strong and likely to improve given the lagged revisions in domestic prices.Jio‚Äôs average revenue per user was in line but the lower subscribers led to revenue and Ebitda miss.Capital expenditure stood at Rs 25,500 crore, and there were no new updates on renewables or Aramco stake sale progress.Maintain FY22-23 estimates as there is no earnings upgrade cycle for now. Refining and retail should be strong in the second half of FY22, while Jio‚Äôs performance depends on tariff hikes.Rate 'neutral' with a target price of Rs 2,465, implying a downside price potential of 6.2%.EmkayO2C Ebitda was impacted by 2% lower feedstock volumes quarter on quarter. GRMs were supported by higher transport fuel cracks, though polymer deltas were down 16-18% and polyester by 15-35%.Jio‚Äôs subs fell by 1.1 crore QoQ due to the churn in the low end. ARPU rose 4% QoQ to Rs 144.Operating conditions continued to improve retail performance, with 89% store operating hours in September 2021 vs 38% in June 2021. Footfalls also recovered to 90% in October 2021 vs 78%/46% in Q2/Q1. The recovery has been broad-based across formats.Net cash stood at Rs 3,590 crore in Q2. Capex was high at Rs 25,000 crore.Management was optimistic about post-pandemic demand recovery going ahead, coupled with higher realisations and margins in the hydrocarbon businesses.Increase FY22/23/24E EPS by 12%/7%/5%, building in higher GRMs and gas prices.Retain 'hold' rating with an 18% increase in target price to Rs 2,750, implying a upside potential of 4.7%.Motilal OswalO2C Ebitda per metric tonne stood at $100 (+49% year on year, +6% quarter on quarter) and benefitted from fuel cracks, efficient product placement, and yield management.Growth for Jio has slowed in the recent past, despite the significant increase in scale and given the lack of tariff action.Reliance Retail‚Äôs consistent performance over the last 4-5 years has been stellar and offers a huge scope of growth, given its strong growth footprint, enhanced digital capabilities in JioMart, Ajio, and new businesses/verticals.The consolidated gross debt remained largely flat at Rs 2,55,900 crore at the end of second quarter FY22 (vs Rs 2,53,900 crore at the end of first quarter FY22), with cash and equivalents at Rs 2,59,500 crore, translating in net cash of Rs 3,600 crore.Reiterate 'buy' with a target price of Rs 2,900/share, implying an upside price potential of 10.4%.ICICI DirectRevenue grew 20.6% QoQ led by retail and O2C segment. All segments reported growth in revenues.Discontinued customers on account of the second Covid-19 wave led to a net customer decline of 1.1 crores (churn rate of 3.6%) in Jio.The launch of JioPhone by Diwali is likely to improve the subscriber addition in Q3 while the ARPU hike seems to be pushed further as the company may focus on garnering more subscriber market share.Reliance Retail witnessed a sharp recovery with store operational days getting enhanced to 89% in second quarter of FY22 (in the first quarter of FY22, it was 61%). Strong recovery was witnessed in footfalls also and reached 78% of pre-Covid levels.Polymer and polyester margins declined QoQ due to higher feedstock prices and impacted sequential growth in O2C Ebitda that grew 4% QoQ. E&P segment revenue was driven by output growth from the KG basin. Revenue at Rs 1,644 crore was up 363.1% year on year (and 28.3% quarter on quarter).Steady fee cash flow generation in the retail segment, stake sale in the O2C segment to a strategic global player, and increment value accretion from the ‚Äòdigital ecosystem‚Äô are the key stock triggers for future stock price performance.Maintain 'hold' with a target price of Rs 2,900, implying an upside potential of 10.4%.Goldman SachsThe retail segment stood out, with core Ebitda up 74% quarter on quarter/21% year on year driven by the omnichannel strategy, new stores' growth momentum, more merchant tie-ups and rising online mix.Energy segment Ebitda growth moderated to 4% QoQ as petrochemical prices narrowed while the exploration and production segment was ahead of our expectations.Expect refining and E&P to drive the next leg of growth for the energy segment while petrochemicals recovery will be sustained.Sustainable earnings recovery momentum driven by retail, telecom (tariff hike likely before CY21) and energy, new digital product launches, and further details on new energy business are likely to drive strong earnings growth of 41% compound annual growth rate over FY21E-23E.Cut FY22/23/24 Ebitda by -4%/-2%/-1% reflecting weaker O2C print in particular for petrochemicals on higher gas feedstock costs, lower Jio earnings through FY22/23 on lower reported subscriber count post second quarter miss.Maintain 'buy' with a target price of Rs 2,855, implying an upside potential of 8.7%.Morgan StanleyDemand improved across all verticals ‚Äì gas, grocery, fashion and lifestyle, and refining.Telecom subscribers, especially broadband, have picked up well and demand is expanding for retail.Over the past year, Jio has seen nearly 9.5 crore subscriber churn. Higher churn in Jio also partly reflects higher subscriber market share in B&C circle areas.Doubling of high-margin apparel and footwear sales helped retail margins.Upstream Ebitda rose 34% QoQ and RIL‚Äôs domestic gas output rose 18.4% QoQ.

Sajid Javid said the government is ""considering"" making the vaccine mandatory for the roughly 100,000 NHS staff who are yet to get their first jab following the recent closure of a consultation into the matter. He told Sky News' Kay Burley: ""We've yet to make a final decision, but I'm leaning towards doing it."" Addressing concerns there is already a shortage of NHS staff, the health secretary said the threat of not being able to work without getting vaccinated would make them have the jab. He said about 95% of NHS staff have already had the vaccine after they were offered it in the first few months of the year. The government has already made the vaccine mandatory for staff in the care sector, where Mr Javid said there has been a big uptake since the rule came into law. He added that it is an issue of patient safety and ""about doing the right thing"" - and most countries in Europe have already made the vaccine mandatory for healthcare staff.

The health secretary added that the booster programme, which started last month, has ramped up over the weekend and urged anyone who is currently eligible to come forward and book online or phone 119. People aged 50 and over, or aged 16 and over who are vulnerable, who have had their second jab six months ago are eligible to get a COVID-19 vaccine booster. Mr Javid added that there are now 500 more vaccination centres offering boosters than there were when the original vaccine was launched in April.",https://e3.365dm.com/21/09/70x70/skynews-breaking-news_5513713.jpg?20210915162827,skynews

Read Full Article at RT.com","Oil prices rallied above $86 a barrel on Monday, extending multi-year gains after Saudi Arabia urged the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to stick to a cautious approach to raising global output. Global benchmark Brent crude jumped 71 cents, or 0.8%, to $86.24 a barrel, continuing growth after seven consecutive weekly gains. Earlier in the session, Brent price brushed $86.43 a barrel, reaching its highest level since October 2018. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 87 cents, or 1%, to $84.63 a barrel at 3:42am GMT, after 1.5% growth on Friday. It also touched its highest price since 2014 at $84.76 earlier in the day. Also on rt.com Forget $100, options traders now betting on oil prices hitting $200 The rally comes after Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman advised producers not to take the rise in oil prices as a constant, noting that while the situation around the Covid-19 pandemic remains unpredictable, oil demand could soon fall. ‚ÄúWe are not yet out of the woods. We need to be careful. The crisis is contained but is not necessarily over,‚Äù bin Salman told Bloomberg TV on Saturday. Another OPEC+ member, Nigeria, followed suit, suggesting that the 23-nation cartel must resist pressure to boost oil production until the pandemic backs down. Similar comments also came from Azerbaijan. Also on rt.com The 2021 oil price rally is far from over Oil prices have more than doubled over the past year as the global economy struggles to recover from the pandemic-induced crisis. While energy consumption has surged and storage has run low, OPEC+ decided earlier this year to raise its monthly crude production by 400,000 barrels. Despite repeated calls to boost output further, the oil alliance has so far resisted pressure to do so. The group is next scheduled to meet on November 4.

Earlier in the session, Brent price brushed $86.43 a barrel, reaching its highest level since October 2018. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 87 cents, or 1%, to $84.63 a barrel at 3:42am GMT, after 1.5% growth on Friday. It also touched its highest price since 2014 at $84.76 earlier in the day. The rally comes after Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman advised producers not to take the rise in oil prices as a constant, noting that while the situation around the Covid-19 pandemic remains unpredictable, oil demand could soon fall. ‚Äú We are not yet out of the woods. We need to be careful. The crisis is contained but is not necessarily over, ‚Äù bin Salman told Bloomberg TV on Saturday. Another OPEC+ member, Nigeria, followed suit, suggesting that the 23-nation cartel must resist pressure to boost oil production until the pandemic backs down. Similar comments also came from Azerbaijan. Oil prices have more than doubled over the past year as the global economy struggles to recover from the pandemic-induced crisis.

The Offload: Busy Saturday for the Carty brothers,https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/the-offload-busy-saturday-for-the-carty-brothers-1.4709341?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"It was a day of contrasting fortunes for Carty brothers, Ireland international Jack and US Eagles‚Äô Luke, who were involved in two high profile matches. Jack was an integral contributor to Connacht‚Äôs 36-11 victory over Ulster at the Aviva stadium. Quite apart from an excellent all-round display he chipped in with 11 points. His brother Luke, five years younger at 24, was playing outhalf for the US Eagles team beaten 104-14 by New Zealand in Landover, Maryland. One of three Irish born players - Paul Mullen from the Aran Island, Inis M√≥r and Wexford born, Dylan Fawsitt - it proved a long and pretty painful afternoon for the home team. Not that anyone was expecting a great deal as the USA had lost a two-legged World Cup qualification tussle with Uruguay recently. And that was with a stronger team as six of their best players returned to European clubs. The All Blacks fielded a seconds/thirds side with a few marquee names but still managed to play some scintillating rugby in running in 16 tries, the first after 29 seconds. A silver lining for the Americans was that they managed to score a first ever try against New Zealand through scrumhalf Nate Augspurger. And as for Luke Carty, well he kicked two conversions and has one up on his older brother in that he has played against New Zealand, something Jack has yet to do. Irish Qualified Talent Trawl One name that was missing from the 34-player England squad for November test matches against Tonga, Australia and South Africa was Leicester Tigers centre Dan Kelly. Eddie Jones capped the 20-year-old against Canada last summer, confirming that the former Ireland Under-20 international has decided to play for the country of his birth. He was a member of the Irish 20s side that won all three matches in the 2020 Six Nations before the tournament was abandoned due to the Covid-19 virus. A student at Loughborough University at the time, the IRFU tried to persuade him to relocate to Ireland but he elected to remain in England. Having played a year young for Ireland he was eligible again for the Irish 20s this year but at that stage he had agreed a contract with the Leicester Tigers and it‚Äôs not unreasonable to assume would have been encouraged by the club to pursue a future with England. There is no doubt that playing underage for Ireland - a year previously he was deemed not good enough for the Sale Sharks academy - gave Kelly a stage to showcase his skills. Popular with his teammates and coaches alike, he grasped the opportunity and it earned him a pro contract with Leicester. No one should begrudge him his choice. Kelly‚Äôs centre partner in that Irish team Hayden Hyde left the Ulster academy to rejoin the Harlequins academy. The Coronavirus pandemic has been a very challenging period for the IRFU‚Äôs IQ (Irish Qualified) talent trawl in Britain under the guidance of Joe Lydon, when there was precious little rugby played. Perhaps the key for the IRFU in persuading young players with Irish heritage to wear a green shirt is to tie up university places in any putative deal that sees them relocating to Ireland; giving them the double benefit of rugby and an education. Leinster‚Äôs Aaron O‚ÄôSullivan - the former Wasps academy prospect is studying at UCD - who is with the Ireland Sevens at the moment is an example of offering the twin strands. England will continue to aggressively ‚Äòcapture‚Äô as it is known, dual qualified players, especially with the English RFU‚Äôs director of performance rugby, Conor O‚ÄôShea‚Äôs network of contacts. As for Kelly, hopefully he won‚Äôt like several dual qualified players before him discover that the grass is indeed greener on the other side of the Irish Sea. Five-star London Irish London Irish won their first match in the English Premiership since last March with a superb five-try, 33-21 victory over the Exeter Chiefs at Sandy Park. The Exiles had drawn two of their five matches in the current campaign and picked up four bonus points along the way but finally managed to marry performance with an end product on the scoreboard. What was also very noticeable was the quality of the rugby they produce; an attacking, enterprising brand under the baton of head coach Les Kiss and director of rugby Declan Kidney that is very easy on the eye. Paddy Jackson was a creative influence but there was no sign of Sean O‚ÄôBrien in the matchday 23. Kiss, who worked under Kidney with Ireland, admitted: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm immensely proud of each and every one of the players. The coaches too, they‚Äôve really worked hard and stayed strong despite not getting the return we‚Äôd have all liked from our opening games. This win is just rewards for that.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe made the most of the big moments; we backed ourselves with the ball in hand, as much as we did without the ball in hand. Defensively we were very solid too. We know it‚Äôs a big ask to come here and beat Exeter, but we‚Äôve been playing well and we played well again here. The boys got what they deserved.‚Äù Number 1 - A first win in the All Ireland League for the Wicklow women‚Äôs rugby team with their 12-7 victory over Malone, a momentous and brilliant achievement when considering that they hadn‚Äôt scored a point and conceded 268 in the first three matches.

And he called on the five millions Brits who haven‚Äôt yet had the vaccine at all to come forward this winter. Asked if he agrees with Boris Johnson that this Christmas will be much better than last year‚Äôs, he replied: ‚ÄúYes, of course. ‚ÄúFor all of those like me hoping and planning for a normal Christmas ‚Äì I do think that‚Äôs where we‚Äôll be ‚Äì if you want that let‚Äôs keep playing our part.‚Äù Mr Javid said people should ‚Äúbe cautious and take sensible actions to try and prevent the spread of the virus‚Äù as winter closes in. In particular he urged people to start taking Lateral Flow Tests before going to visit elderly relatives. He also said Brits should wear masks in crowded public places and keep up basic hygiene practices like hand washing. No Plan B Mr Javid insisted the pandemic data doesn‚Äôt yet show that the Government needs to trigger Plan B. He said: ‚ÄúWe are not at that point. Whether we get there or not, we will see. ‚ÄúBut the best thing we can all do to try and prevent us moving to Plan B or taking any further measures is to get out there and get our vaccines.‚Äù The health secretary also said he is ‚Äúleaning towards‚Äù making jabs mandatory for all NHS workers within weeks. His remarks came after NHS England‚Äôs top doctor urged Brits to get their booster jabs to save festive celebrations. Professor Stephen Powis said people must ‚Äútake up the offer‚Äù of a third dose to ‚Äúprotect the freedom and Christmas that we have all earned‚Äù. Mr Javid said the booster rollout has ‚Äúpicked up substantially‚Äù in recent days as more and more people come forward. A record 800,000 jabs were administered during the final three days of last week, including 325,140 on Saturday alone. And the PM was also handed another major boost as scientists predicted Covid cases will plummet within weeks without the need for Plan B. Experts believe the number of new infections could sink from 50,000 a day now to just 5,000 in time for Christmas.

More contagious offshoot of Delta coronavirus variant found in UK. What is it?,https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/delta-coronavirus-variant-ay-4-2-uk-india-symptoms-vaccine-1869060-2021-10-25?utm_source=rss,,,,More contagious offshoot of Delta Covid variant found in UK. What is it?,,10/25/21 7:58,"In a reminder that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over yet, scientists are closely monitoring a new mutation of the Delta variant, named AY.4.2 . This comes amid a rise in cases in the United Kingdom (UK). AY.4.2 has also been found in India ""in very low numbers"", said scientists of INSACOG, a forum set up by the Union health ministry, a TOI report said. The new variant, which scientists say may be more transmissible than the Delta strain, has been declared as a ""Variant Under Investigation (VUI)"" (VUI-21OCT-01) in the UK. ‚ÄúThe designation was made on the basis that this sub-lineage has become increasingly common in the UK in recent months, and there is some early evidence that it may have an increased growth rate in the UK compared to Delta,‚Äù the UK health security agency said. ‚ÄúMore evidence is needed to know whether this is due to changes in the virus‚Äô behaviour or to epidemiological conditions,‚Äù the UK health security agency said. According to the UK health security agency, about 6 per cent of Covid-19 cases that were genetically sequenced last week were of the AY.4.2 mutation. The Delta variant was behind the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in the UK in spring, leading to enforcement of stringent lockdowns. Britain has recorded the highest number of new Covid-19 cases since July over the past week. Daily infections have been hovering over the 49,000 mark. What is AY.4.2? Since viruses mutate all the time, new versions are bound to emerge. The AY.4.2 mutation of the Delta variant was first noticed in July 2021 and since then it has been slowly increasing. Is AY.4.2 more transmissible? A report in the BBC says AY.4.2 contains mutations that might give the virus survival advantages. There has also been preliminary evidence that it spreads more quickly than the dominant Delta variant. AY.4.2 contains spike mutations Y145H and A222V that help the virus enter human cells more easily. Professor Francois Balloux, director of University College London's Genetics Institute, told the BBC that ""AY.4.2 is potentially a marginally more infectious strain"". How much more transmissible? ""It's nothing compared with what we saw with Alpha and Delta, which were something like 50 to 60 per cent more transmissible. So, we are talking about something quite subtle here and that is currently under investigation. It is likely to be up to 10 per cent more transmissible,"" Francois Balloux told the BBC. A few cases have also been identified in the US and infections with AY.4.2 are growing in Denmark and Israel.",,indiatoday

Ottawa Public Health says you can get a COVID-19 test at an assessment centre, care clinic, or community testing site if any of the following apply to you: You are showing COVID-19 symptoms; You have been exposed to a confirmed case of the virus, as informed by Ottawa Public Health or exposure notification through the COVID Alert app; You are a resident or work in a setting that has a COVID-19 outbreak, as identified and informed by Ottawa Public Health; You are a resident, a worker or a visitor to long-term care, retirement homes, homeless shelters or other congregate settings (for example: group homes, community supported living, disability-specific communities or congregate settings, short-term rehab, hospices and other shelters); You are a person who identifies as First Nations, Inuit or M√©tis; You are a person travelling to work in a remote First Nations, Inuit or M√©tis community; You received a preliminary positive result through rapid testing; You are a patient and/or their 1 accompanying escort tra¬≠velling out of country for medical treatment; You are a farm worker; You are an educator who cannot access pharmacy-testing; or You are in a targeted testing group as outlined in guidance from the Chief Medical Officer of Health. Long-term care staff, caregivers, volunteers and visitors who are fully immunized against COVID-19 are not required to present a negative COVID-19 test before entering or visiting a long-term care home. Where to get tested for COVID-19 in Ottawa: There are several sites for COVID-19 testing in Ottawa.

COVID-19 cases in Ottawa rose steadily in September 2020 and a similar trend was seen in 2021, but with a majority of the city vaccinated against COVID-19, the wave this fall was much less harsh than it was in 2020. Figures from Ottawa Public Health, available on Open Ottawa, show that active COVID-19 cases peaked at 1,501 on Oct. 3, 2020 before they started to decline again. By Oct. 23, the active case count had dropped to 1,367. In 2021, the peak during the most recent wave was 740 active cases on Sept. 18. Ottawa's caseload has since dropped to 242 active cases as of Sunday's most recent snapshot from OPH, a fraction of what it was on the same date in 2020. The main difference between 2020 and 2021 is the vaccine. There was no approved vaccine in Canada in the fall of 2020. As of last Friday, 90 per cent of residents of Ottawa who are eligible have had at least one dose and 86 per cent are fully vaccinated. The province has created mandates requiring proof of vaccination to visit many non-essential businesses, including restaurants, but some businesses had been enforcing their own vaccination requirements before the provincial system was launched. The presence of vaccines and the widespread coverage also correlates with a markedly lower caseload in Ottawa hospitals. On Oct. 23, 2020, there were 36 COVID-19 patients in local hospitals. On Oct. 23, 2021, there were six. The 2021 fall wave peaked at 20 hospitalizations due to COVID-19, with 12 people in the ICU on Sept. 30. In the fall wave of 2020, the peak number of hospitalizations was 49 while ICU admissions peaked at 10. Snapshot: Oct. 23, 2020 vs. Oct. 23, 2021 Infogram Ottawa ICUs free of COVID-19 on Sunday Ottawa Public Health said Sunday that local ICUs are free of any patients with COVID-19. Twenty-six more people in the city have tested positive. To date, OPH has recorded 30,694 lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ottawa since the pandemic began. No new deaths were reported on Sunday. Since March 2020, 602 residents of Ottawa have lost their lives to COVID-19. The number of known active cases ticked up slightly on Sunday but hospitalizations are down. The seven-day average for new cases in Ottawa is 29.2 cases per day. That's up from 26.6 cases per day one week ago, but down from an average of 54.4 four weeks ago.

Getty Images Ten months into his presidency and 20 months into the pandemic, Joe Biden finds himself in a difficult position. He‚Äôs trying to lead the ‚Äú battle against Covid-19 ‚Äù while living in an age of politics. It‚Äôs not going well. A whopping 66 million Americans remain unvaccinated, despite being eligible. Average daily deaths from Covid-19 crossed the 2,200 mark last month, the highest total since early spring. Meanwhile, elected officials and government agencies remain embroiled in partisan disputes over practically every aspect of the pandemic response. These are deflating facts given the months of masking and social distancing, the travel bans, the shutdown orders, the dozens of bills batted around Congress, the disparate undertakings of two polar-opposite presidents and the surge of vaccine mandates that followed FDA approval. Despite all we‚Äôve tried, the pandemic is nearly 600 days old and still very far from over. The nation‚Äôs baffling Covid-19 response can be best summed up by this absurdist quote from Lewis Carroll‚Äôs ‚ÄúThrough The Looking-Glass‚Äù: Getty Images Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that! ‚Äì The Red Queen Applied to our nation‚Äôs ongoing public health crisis, the Red Queen‚Äôs foolish logic makes perfect sense. Americans keep scurrying and hurrying and getting practically nowhere. With no clear path out of this pandemic, President Biden has only three options left. MORE FOR YOU CDC: Salmonella Outbreak Has Left 279 Ill, 26 Hospitalized In 29 States Canadians End Up In ICU After Attending ‚ÄòCovid Party‚Äô White House Mandates Pfizer Vaccines for Millions of Citizens ...Before the FDA Clinical or Safety Reviews Have Been Made Public 1. Run twice as fast Like the Red Queen said, ‚ÄúIf you want to get somewhere else,‚Äù to the end of the pandemic, for example, ‚Äúyou must run at least twice as fast as (you already are)!‚Äù In this running-faster scenario, Biden would need to double the efforts outlined in his ‚Äú Path Out of the Pandemic ‚Äù plan‚Äîa 5,000-word compendium of past and present government actions that include a nationwide vaccine mandate for companies with 100 or more employees. Meaning, why stop at 100 ? At present, there are about 165,000 registered businesses with at least 100 workers . But there are another 150,000 companies with 50 to 99 employees. Why not extend the mandate to those businesses and, while we‚Äôre at it, to any person or organization receiving federal funds (e.g., beneficiaries of Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and any federal grant)? Running twice as fast would also mean introducing vaccine mandates to public schools within 60 days of the FDA and CDC‚Äôs full approvals. Health experts expect to see unconditional vaccine approval for kids ages 12-17 by year‚Äôs end, followed by children ages 5-11 in 2022 (for whom emergency authorization plans were announced last week). It‚Äôs not too late to take aggressive action. Assuming the courts side with stiffer mandates and uphold them as enforceable (as has been the judicial trend so far), a strategy in which ‚Äú the overwhelming majority of people get vaccinated ‚Äù is the only way the United States will reach national herd immunity by early 2022. 2. Keep running in place, but tell Americans the truth The Delta variant, which accounts for 99% of new cases in the United States, is twice as contagious as the original strain and equally lethal, according to CDC data . This explains why our country‚Äôs infection rate has held steady (somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 new cases per day) despite the nation‚Äôs rising immunization rate . What‚Äôs most concerning about Delta is that its elevated transmissibility has raised the threshold for herd immunity‚Äîup from 70% of the U.S. population to an estimated 90% . The implication of this higher threshold is as clear as it is painful: America‚Äôs current vaccination efforts and policies will not end the pandemic. The problem, here, is that Biden‚Äôs Covid-19 action plan is filled with politically measured half steps rather than bold strides, thus preventing us from making meaningful progress. As an example, look closely at the president‚Äôs vaccine mandate for businesses. More than a month has passed since Biden announced the requirement, yet there‚Äôs still no clear indication of a timeline , an implementation strategy, a monitoring method or confirmed penalties for noncompliance . In his most recent public remarks, Biden said the Labor Department will begin enforcing these requirements ‚Äú soon .‚Äù But ‚Äúsoon‚Äù is not a deadline or a clear path out of the pandemic. It is an example of the ambiguity that keeps our nation running in place. If Biden intends to stay on this path, he owes the nation a long-overdue dose of reality. He should tell the public the truth: that the United States will never reach herd immunity through immunization, not with the partisanship, misinformation and vaccine hesitancy still plaguing our nation. The hard truth is that this path will leave approximately 50-60 million unvaccinated adults vulnerable to the disease. The United States theoretically could achieve herd immunity this way, but only through infection. And based on known mortality figures, there would be an additional 100,000 to 200,000 American deaths, even with the pending availability of more effective treatments for infected patients . Opting to run in place is an option, but one that requires President Biden to publicly acknowledge the difficult facts. As painful as it would be to admit the truth, demonstrating clarity and honesty would be the best way to rebuild the nation‚Äôs trust. 3. Start running in a new direction Biden‚Äôs final option is to run in a different direction, altogether. And to do that, he must take full stock of America‚Äôs deteriorating health status. After so many months of toiling through this pandemic, it helps to remind ourselves why we adopted a shelter-in-place strategy in the first place. Starting in 2020, the intent of social distancing wasn‚Äôt to defeat the virus. It was to ‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù of new infections enough to avoid overwhelming hospitals. And the reason we needed beds available was to treat both patients with coronavirus and those with acute, non-Covid medical problems, such as heart attacks, strokes and trauma. That plan, along with the availability of vaccines in 2021, worked in some places. But not in all. As of last month, ICU capacity topped 90% in seven states . Twelve states had over 40% of their ICU beds occupied by Covid-19 patients. These localized surges have kept too many Americans from obtaining their necessary screenings or treatments. One poll found that a third of U.S. adults have delayed or skipped medical care because of the pandemic. As a result, national screening rates for cervical, colon and breast cancer are down between 86% and 94%, leaving millions of potentially deadly illnesses undiagnosed and untreated. The pandemic has also caused a precipitous decline in routine pediatric immunizations, leaving children vulnerable to highly contagious diseases like measles and whopping cough. To reverse this troubling trend, Biden must target his presidential powers more strategically and effectively. Since July, the federal government has been deploying surge response teams to hospitals overwhelmed by Covid-19. However, that‚Äôs like sending fire trucks to a building already in ashes. Once the ICUs are overflowing with patients, the window of opportunity has already closed. This explains why, months after Biden‚Äôs initiative began, state officials indicated the resources they received have not stopped cases and deaths from rising. Instead of trying to lend emergency support after the surge, Biden could do more to prevent these spikes. Though the executive branch must always tread lightly with state‚Äôs rights, the president could decide he‚Äôs not going to let Covid-stricken zones threaten the health of the entire country. And with the four months left in his national emergency redeclaration , Biden could deploy federal response personnel to ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù at the first sign of an outbreak. These units would increase Covid-19 testing and enforce emergency lockdown orders, supplying a federal intervention that could prevent hospitals from becoming overrun with new cases. This strategy would ensure more Americans can get the screenings, treatments and non-Covid immunizations they desperately require, thus saving tens of thousands of lives from a variety of public-health threats. Where should I go? It depends on where you want to end up Our nation‚Äôs current ‚Äúpath out‚Äù plan is, unfortunately, incapable of ending this pandemic swiftly or safely. In its current form, it wastes money and energy and erodes trust in our elected officials. Of course, it‚Äôs not solely this president‚Äôs fault that our nation has failed to control the virus. Blame belongs to many individuals and agencies, with missteps tracing back to the earliest days of Covid-19 and the previous administration. But in a time of crisis, it is the president‚Äôs job to be a leader, not just a politician. To lead, Biden must pick one strategy, communicate it clearly and do everything in his power to ensure his fellow Americans follow through. It‚Äôs time for our nation to stop running in place.",https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/0x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/617425928d78ddef559ee046/0x0.jpg?cropX1=0&cropX2=1815&cropY1=91&cropY2=1112,forbes

The NRL announced last week it would not follow the AFL‚Äôs lead in mandating vaccines for players, but the league is still working with the Rugby League Players Association (RLPA) to develop a policy for handling unvaccinated players. Kayo is your ticket to the best local and international sport streaming Live & On-Demand. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial > The RLPA chief executive Clint Newton told NCA NewsWire last week that while most players had complied with the PA‚Äôs recommendation to become vaccinated, a minority remained hesitant to do so at the conclusion of the 2021 season. Newton said while it remained legal and logistically possible to do so, the RLPA expected NRL clubs would continue to employ unvaccinated players. On Monday, V‚Äôlandys echoed Newton‚Äôs comments, encouraging clubs not to be deterred from signing up unvaxxed players. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of hysteria that goes on about this issue (but) a vaccinated person can also catch this disease and pass it on, just like an unvaccinated person,‚Äù he told News Corp. ‚ÄúAn unvaccinated player is at no more risk than a vaccinated player. The only risk is that he will get very, very sick, while a vaccinated player may not get very sick at all.‚Äù A report released by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last month indicated those who were unvaccinated were 11 times likelier to die from Covid-19 than their vaccinated peers.

After a breakout season with the South Sydney Rabbitohs, Keaon Koloamatangi has signed a new NRL contract. The claws are well and truly out between Paul Gallen and Josh Aloiai as both took shots at each other on social media ahead of a mooted bout. The NRL has reportedly made contact with a woman over an alleged night spot incident which was first raised in a deleted Instagram post.",,news

He termed the project an important document on the history of Arunachal Pradesh at a meeting with the members of the core committee and sub-committee for the recognition of the State's unsung heroes, here on Saturday. The State government had in September formed a five-member core committee headed by Mein to conduct research on the contribution of various personalities of the state in the country's freedom struggle. The committee has been tasked with collecting and examining authentic documents, archives, journals, available in the libraries and other places, seeking comments of eminent personalities and others in this regard, visiting places of relevant historical interests and taking steps as deemed fit to give recognition to the unsung freedom fighters of Arunachal. The research work and documentation, after being compiled and completed, would be forwarded to the State government. Chief Minister Pema Khandu who has been spearheading the initiative had told the Assembly in September that the State government would build a memorial for all the ""unsung"" freedom fighters from the State, besides requesting the Centre to also honour them. Mein on the occasion also informed the members of the house that the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), a captive body of the Union Ministry of Education, is planning to conduct a workshop-cum-seminar in the State early next year as part of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. He asked Rajiv Gandhi University Vice-Chancellor Saket Kushwaha and member secretary of the core committee, Dani Salu, to coordinate with the member-secretary of ICHR. Meanwhile, the house present decided to propose the ICHR to set up a centre in Arunachal Pradesh. Such a centre in the State would facilitate the research scholars and students carrying out research works and studies on the rich history and culture of Arunachal Pradesh, the members of the panel said. The committee also decided to participate in the live online series on social media on unsung heroes which would be conducted by ICHR. Prof Kushwaha during the meeting, presented a timeline to be followed by the sub-committee which shall work under the aegis of the RGU. According to the timeline, the sub-committee will submit the final report by the end of June 2022. In the meeting, Nepha Wangsa, author of The Nyinu Massacre, showed the collection of original documents from the national archive of the British Library in New Delhi. These documents will be handed over to the core committee through a formal ceremony at a later date. The house decided to store it in the State archive of the research department and also to put it on a website after the finalization of the research and documentation works.

CytoDyn Announces Treatment of First Patient in Pivotal Phase 3 Trial for Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients in Brazil,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/25/2319637/19782/en/CytoDyn-Announces-Treatment-of-First-Patient-in-Pivotal-Phase-3-Trial-for-Critically-Ill-COVID-19-Patients-in-Brazil.html,"['BIOTECHNOLOGY', 'COVID-19', 'Coronavirus']",['CytoDyn Inc.'],,"Based on previous strong sub-population analysis in CD12 trial, CytoDyn intends to file for an EUA when interim analysis of 127 patients is completed",,10/25/21 10:00,"Based on previous strong sub-population analysis in CD12 trial, CytoDyn intends to file for an EUA when interim analysis of 127 patients is completed VANCOUVER, Washington, Oct. 25, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CytoDyn Inc. (OTCQB: CYDY) (""CytoDyn"" or the ""Company""), a late-stage biotechnology company developing leronlimab, a CCR5 antagonist with the potential for multiple therapeutic indications, announced today the treatment of the first patient in its pivotal Phase 3 trial (CD16) in Brazil for critically ill COVID-19 patients. An interim analysis will be conducted 28 days following the enrollment of 127 patients. On September 9, 2021, the Company announced the treatment of the first patient in its other pivotal Phase 3 trial in Brazil (CD17). An interim analysis for this trial will be conducted 28 days after 245 patients have been enrolled. This new pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (CD16) will focus on hospitalized critically ill COVID-19 patients who require mechanical and invasive ventilation or Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). Leronlimab is administered via intravenous therapy (IV) in four doses or 700 mg per week. The trial is being conducted across 29 research centers (hospitals) with 316 patients. The table below summarizes results CytoDyn received from its CD12 clinical trial, and the related dosing compared to the dosing of CD-16 (critical COVID-19): Dose Injection Day CD12 - Survival Benefit vs Placebo CD12 - Subcutaneous (SQ) Dose CD16 - Intravenous (IV) Dose 1 st Day 7 +78 % SQ ‚Äì 700 mg IV ‚Äì 700 mg 2 nd Day 14 +82 % SQ ‚Äì 700 mg IV ‚Äì 700 mg 3 rd Day 21 +50 % None IV ‚Äì 700 mg 4 th Day 28 +31 % None IV ‚Äì 700 mg Nader Pourhassan, Ph.D., CytoDyn‚Äôs President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, ‚ÄúThe CytoDyn team, along with BIOMM and ARO, have worked diligently to initiate two pivotal Phase 3 trials in Brazil, and we are excited about the trials‚Äô potential results. We are seeing strong optimism from all of the doctors and individuals involved in this project, especially since the primary endpoint for CD16 is similar to an endpoint in our past CD12 trial, which produced 166% better results in the leronlimab arm versus placebo. Importantly, this trial provides for two additional doses and delivery via IV (which allows leronlimab absorption to occur within 1-2 hours of being administered compared to 2-3 days when administered via SQ). We continue to be very impressed by the execution and professionalism of our partners in Brazil and, accordingly, anticipate a relatively rapid rate of enrollment if the patients are available, including the scheduled interim analyses for both Phase 3 trials. We are hopeful to be in a position to make leronlimab available for patients with severe or critical symptoms in the coming months.‚Äù About Leronlimab The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted CytoDyn Fast Track designation to explore two potential indications using leronlimab to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and metastatic cancer. The first indication is combination therapy with HAART for HIV-infected patients, and the second is for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC). Leronlimab is an investigational humanized IgG4 mAb that binds to CCR5, a cellular receptor important in HIV infection, tumor metastases, and other diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Leronlimab has been studied in 16 clinical trials involving more than 1,200 people and met its primary endpoints in a pivotal Phase 3 trial (leronlimab combined with HIV standard care in patients with multi-drug resistance to current available classes of HIV drugs). Leronlimab, among various potential applications, is a viral-entry inhibitor in HIV/AIDS. It binds to CCR5, thus protecting healthy T cells from viral infection by blocking the predominant HIV (R5) subtype from entering those cells. Leronlimab does not work on other strains of HIV (for example X4), however, R5 is the most dominant strain of HIV. Five clinical trials have demonstrated leronlimab could significantly reduce or control HIV viral load in humans. The leronlimab antibody appears to be a powerful antiviral agent with fewer side effects and less frequent dosing requirements than currently used daily drug therapies. Cancer research has shown CCR5 may play a role in tumor invasion, metastases, and tumor microenvironment control (for example, through angiogenesis). Published studies have shown that blocking CCR5 can reduce tumor metastases in laboratory and animal models of aggressive breast and prostate cancer. Leronlimab reduced human breast cancer metastasis by more than 97% in a murine xenograft model. As a result, CytoDyn is conducting two clinical trials, one, a Phase 2 in mTNBC, which was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA in 2019, and a second, a Phase 2, basket trial which encompasses 22 different solid tumor cancers. The CCR5 receptor plays a central role in modulating immune cell trafficking to sites of inflammation. After completing two clinical trials with COVID-19 patients (a Phase 2 and a Phase 3), CytoDyn initiated a Phase 2 investigative trial for post-acute sequelae of SARS COV-2 (PASC), also known as COVID-19 Long-Haulers. This trial evaluated the effect of leronlimab on clinical symptoms and laboratory biomarkers to further understand the pathophysiology of PASC. It is currently estimated that between 10-30% of those infected with COVID-19 develop long-term sequelae. Common symptoms include fatigue, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, and shortness of breath. CytoDyn plans to pursue clinical trials to evaluate leronlimab‚Äôs effect on immunological dysregulation in other post-viral syndromes, including myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). CytoDyn is also conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial for NASH to evaluate the effect of leronlimab on liver steatosis and fibrosis. Pre-clinical studies revealed a significant reduction in NAFLD and a reduction in liver fibrosis using leronlimab. There are currently no FDA approved treatments for NASH, which is a leading cause of liver transplant. About 30 to 40 percent of adults in the U.S. live with NAFLD, and 3 to 12 percent of adults in the U.S. live with NASH. There have been no strong safety signals identified in patients administered leronlimab in multiple disease spectrums, including patients with HIV, COVID-19, and oncology. About CytoDyn CytoDyn is a late-stage biotechnology company developing innovative treatments for multiple therapeutic indications using leronlimab, a novel humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the CCR5 receptor. CCR5 plays a critical role in the ability of HIV to enter and infect healthy T-cells and appears to be implicated in tumor metastasis and immune-mediated illnesses, such as NASH. CytoDyn successfully completed a Phase 3 pivotal trial using leronlimab combined with standard antiretroviral therapies in HIV-infected patients who were heavily treatment-experienced individuals with limited treatment options. CytoDyn is working diligently to resubmit its Biologics License Application (""BLA"") for this HIV combination therapy since receiving a Refusal to File in July 2020. In July 2021, CytoDyn announced that it had submitted a dose justification report to the FDA, an integral step in the resubmission process for its BLA, which it expects to complete during the first calendar quarter of 2022. CytoDyn also completed a Phase 2b/3 investigative trial with leronlimab used as a once-weekly monotherapy for HIV-infected patients. CytoDyn plans to initiate a registration-directed study of leronlimab monotherapy indication. If successful, it could support a label expansion approval. Clinical results to date from two trials have shown that leronlimab can maintain a suppressed viral load in a sub-population of R5 HIV patients who chose to switch from their daily pills regimen to once-a-week subcutaneous dose of leronlimab. Several patients on leronlimab‚Äôs Phase 2b extension arm have remained virally suppressed for almost 7 years and many patients in our Phase 2b/3 investigative trial are passing two and some four years of monotherapy with suppressed viral load. CytoDyn is also conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial with leronlimab in mTNBC, a Phase 2 basket trial in solid tumor cancers (22 different cancer indications), Phase 2 investigative trial for post-acute sequelae of SARS COV-2, also known as COVID-19 long haulers, and a Phase 2 clinical trial for NASH. CytoDyn has already completed a Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial for mild-to-moderate and severe-to-critical COVID-19 patients, respectively, for which CytoDyn did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints except for the secondary endpoint in the critically ill subpopulation.

Russia marks another record number of daily COVID-19 cases,https://www.nsnews.com/coronavirus-covid-19-national-news/russia-marks-another-record-number-of-daily-covid-19-cases-4546852,,['Canadian Press'],,MOSCOW (AP) ‚Äî Russia reported another daily record of confirmed coronavirus cases Monday as a surge in infections has prompted the Kremlin to tell most people to stay away from work starting later this week.,,10/25/21 10:01,"MOSCOW (AP) ‚Äî Russia reported another daily record of confirmed coronavirus cases Monday as a surge in infections has prompted the Kremlin to tell most people to stay away from work starting later this week. The Russian government's coronavirus task force tallied 37,930 new confirmed cases in 24 hours, the highest number since the start of the pandemic. The task force also reported 1,069 more COVID-19 deaths in the same period, slightly fewer than a record of 1,075 reached over the weekend. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russians not to go to work between Oct. 30 and Nov. 7, when the country will observe an extended holiday. In some of Russia's 85 regions where the situation is particularly grave, Putin said the nonworking period could begin earlier and be extended beyond Nov. 7. During that time, most state organizations and private businesses, except for those operating key infrastructure and a few others, are to halt work. Officials in Moscow plan to order the off-work period to start Thursday. Gyms, most entertainment venues and most stores are to be closed for 11 days along with kindergartens and schools. Restaurants and cafes will only be open for takeout or delivery orders during that period. Food stores and pharmacies can stay open. Access to museums, theaters, concert halls and other venues will be limited to those holding digital codes on their smartphones to prove vaccination or past illness, a practice that will remain in place after Nov. 7. Russian authorities hope the idle time will help limit the spread of the virus by keeping people out of offices and off public transportation, where mask mandates have been loosely enforced. Overall, Russia has registered over 8.2 million confirmed virus cases and 231,669 deaths, by far the highest death toll in Europe and the fifth-highest in the world after the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico. The government has blamed the latest spike in infections and deaths on low vaccination rates and lax public attitudes toward taking precautions. Only about 45 million Russians ‚Äî roughly a third of the country's nearly 146 million people ‚Äî are fully vaccinated. Russia was the first country in the world to authorize a coronavirus vaccine, launching Sputnik V in August 2020, and has plentiful supplies. But uptake has been slow, blamed in part on conflicting signals from authorities. ___ Follow AP's pandemic coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic Vladimir Isachenkov, The Associated Press",,nsnews

Twenty pregnant or postpartum women treated in ICU with Covid-19 since June,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/twenty-pregnant-or-postpartum-women-treated-in-icu-with-covid-19-since-june-1.4709985?localLinksEnabled=false,,['Sarah Burns'],,"Further 1,845 new cases reported, 497 patients in hospital, 99 in intensive care",,10/25/21 10:28,"Twenty pregnant or postpartum women have needed intensive care (ICU) treatment for Covid-19 since the end of June, the chair of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has said. Dr Cliona Murphy , an obstetrician at the Coombe Hospital in Dublin, said the figures were ‚Äúquite striking‚Äù. ‚ÄúBefore that, in the months from the end of last November to June, there were 22 [women requiring ICU], but just from June to October, to have 20 is quite significant,‚Äù Dr Murphy told RT√â Radio‚Äôs News at One on Monday. Dr Murphy said over the last two days three women had to be transferred from maternity hospitals in Dublin city to general hospitals for ICU, which ‚Äúhas given us a bit of a shock‚Äù. Dr Murphy also said there is generally one person a year who might require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a specialised life support unit, but there has been ‚Äúa handful of people who‚Äôve needed ECMO this year and that is extraordinary for obstetrics‚Äù. She said women who have just given birth and have to be moved to ICU for Covid-19 treatment could be there for up to five weeks. Dr Murphy said pop-up vaccination clinics for pregnant women and their partners who have not been vaccinated will be operating across maternity hospitals this week. ‚ÄúIf somebody gets Covid and they are pregnant, they have a one in 20 risk of hospitalisation, and if they end up coming into hospital because of symptoms, they‚Äôve a 10 per cent risk of ICU admission ‚Äì which is quite something ‚Äì and up to 43 per cent risk of caesarean section and about a 20 per cent risk of having a premature baby because of it,‚Äù Dr Murphy added. ‚ÄúThe odds are not in favour of somebody pregnant getting Covid.‚Äù The Department of Health reported 1,845 new cases of Covid-19 on Monday. The number of patients being treated in hospital was 497 as of 8am this morning, with 99 of those in ICU. The HSE‚Äôs national director for the vaccination programme said about 2,000 people have been registering for a Covid-19 vaccine daily over recent days. Damien McCallion said since Thursday the figures have doubled from around 800 to 1,000 people registering per day. Mr McCallion told RT√â Radio‚Äôs Morning Ireland programme on Monday that a national campaign will run over the next 10 days encouraging those who have yet come forward for a Covid-19 vaccine to do so. He said that more than 60 per cent of the people being treated in intensive care are unvaccinated. Mr McCallion said the campaign will focus on those who are medically vulnerable and deemed high risk along with others who have received their first dose but not their second and some who registered but didn‚Äôt receive the vaccine. He said the HSE will also be looking at geographic areas where take-up is low and running targeted local campaigns. He said those coming forward for vaccination at the moment are ‚Äúspread broadly across all the ages‚Äù including some people in their 80s. Mr McCallion also said there are about 1,800 healthcare staff out of work due to Covid-19, either sick with the virus or deemed a close contact. He said this was significant ‚Äúboth in terms of the people themselves and the impact on the services they work in‚Äù. He said the National Immunisation Advisory Committee was looking at the issue of healthcare workers receiving a booster vaccine and that their advice ‚Äúhas served us well‚Äù. ‚ÄúFrom an operational perspective in the HSE we‚Äôre making contingency plans so that when that advice comes we can move fairly quickly and in general because people registered first time round we will be able to proactively call people,‚Äù he said. He said people over 65 in long-term residential care and the over 80s are currently receiving booster vaccines.",https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4709984.1635168755!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg,irishtimes
Did Covid-19 lead to extinction of Influenza B virus?,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/covid-19-influenza-b-virus-extinct-india-vaccine-who-cdc-1869131-2021-10-25?utm_source=rss,,,,Did Covid-19 lead to extinction of Influenza B virus?,,10/25/21 10:35,"While coronavirus has emerged as the worst havoc in modern times, the pandemic may have silently led to the extinction of an influenza virus, which has been a seasonal epidemic in several parts of the world. There has been a notable reduction in influenza cases since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. One particular flu viral infection agent, the B/Yamagata lineage of Influenza B virus, was not detected from April 2020 to August 2021. According to a research paper published in Nature Reviews microbiology , the developments suggest that influenza lineage may have become extinct, which may provide opportunities for improving the availability and effectiveness of influenza vaccines. Reportedly, detection of Influenza virus cases dropped significantly from April 2020 with a ""99 per cent reduction compared with previous years despite roughly similar levels of testing."" ""The genetic diversity of influenza viruses has also dramatically diminished. The number of cases detected has fallen for both influenza A (H3N2) and A (H1N1) subtypes, and, similarly, diversity has diminished for the B/Victoria lineage,"" the paper stated. The paper, however, also noted that the IBV lineages have been known to periodically enter a state of ""dormancy"" for long time intervals. Influenza B was mostly undetected globally during the 1990s, except for an outbreak in Asia. WHAT IS THE INFLUENZA VIRUS? Influenza is a group of viruses that leads to contagious respiratory illness infecting the nose, throat, and at times lungs. There are four types of seasonal influenza viruses, types A, B, C and D. Influenza A viruses are further classified into subtype A (H1N1) and A (H3N2). According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Influenza B viruses are not classified into subtypes but can be broken down into lineages. Currently circulating influenza type B viruses belong to either B/Yamagata or B/Victoria lineage. The initial symptoms of Influenza include sudden onset of fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat and a runny nose. While most people recover in a couple of weeks, severe cases may lead to death. WHAT COULD HAVE TRIGGERED A REDUCTION IN CASES? Researchers have said that the global circulation patterns of influenza viruses have been associated with age-specific patterns of infection. Pregnant women, children under 59 months, the elderly, individuals with chronic medical conditions are at a higher risk of being affected by the virus. Led by Marios Koutsakos of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne, the researchers speculate that behavioural changes (social distancing, mask-wearing and hygiene measures), travel and movement restrictions could be the major factors driving the reduction in influenza incidence. ""The reduction in global movement due to the Covid-19 pandemic may have contributed to low distribution and seeding of B/Yamagata and with B/Victoria prevalence increasing since 2019, B/Yamagata may have already been at a low prevalence cycle at the beginning of the pandemic,"" the paper added. Meanwhile, the reduction in cases could bode well for the health sector, which now has more vaccines to fight fewer strains of the virus and work on improving the effectiveness of the doses in fighting those remaining strains.",,indiatoday

The agency had initially hoped to launch the test flight by the end of this year, with astronauts set to walk on the Moon by 2024. Artist impression of Nasa‚Äôs Orion spacecraft It achieved a major milestone last Wednesday when it stacked the Orion crew capsule atop its Space Launch System megarocket. The huge spacecraft now stands 322 feet (98 meters) tall inside the Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After further tests, it will be wheeled out to the launchpad for a ‚Äúwet dress rehearsal‚Äù in January. That involves the full launch team following exact launch day procedures by testing and fuelling the rocket in a real-life countdown. The first window for the lunar launch opening is in February, officials told reporters on a call on Friday. ‚ÄúThe February launch period opens on the 12th and our last opportunity in February is on the 27th,‚Äù said Mike Sarafin, Artemis 1 mission manager. The next windows are in March and April.

The mission duration is expected to be four to six weeks. NASA will also deploy small satellites, known as CubeSats, to perform experiments and technology demonstrations. Artemis 2 is then scheduled for 2023 and Artemis 3 for the following year, when humans will walk on the Moon for the first time since 1972. Both missions are now likely to be pushed back, however. NASA says the moonwalkers will include the first woman and first person of colour to make the trip. The space agency is seeking to establish a sustainable presence on the Moon as well as use the lessons it learns to plan a crewed trip to Mars in the 2030s. Orion first flew into space in 2014, launched by a Delta IV rocket, making two circumnavigations of Earth and testing its heat shield on re-entry into the atmosphere. But this time, NASA‚Äôs Sarafin said, the capsule will travel much faster and the temperature will be much higher when it returns from the Moon. Artemis 1 has several objectives: To demonstrate Orion‚Äôs ability to return from the Moon and operate in deep space where it is ‚Äúmuch colder than in low Earth orbit,‚Äù and to successfully recover the spacecraft, he added. The mission also plans to study radiation and take selfies of the capsule with the Moon in the background.

Customers can also buy Faster Vouchers using their Clubcard points at any time of year, and these are valid for 21 months. How do Tesco Clubcard vouchers work? Vouchers are collected when you shop with the supermarket and can then be used to pay for food, clothes and fuel at Tesco in store or online. You get one point for every ¬£1 spent ‚Äì or one point for every ¬£2 on fuel- and 150 points is equivalent to a ¬£1.50 voucher. Many shoppers choose to spend their coupons with Tesco‚Äôs reward partners to get better value for money. Points are worth up to three times more when you redeem them with one of the supermarket‚Äôs partners. At the moment, Tesco is offering Clubcard members deals with Disney Plus, English Heritage and the RAC. How can I extend my points? If you‚Äôre worried about how to use up your vouchers before the deadline, there‚Äôs a trick to extend them even further. MoneySavingExpert¬†has previously revealed a trick to extend points that are about to expire. You can add another two years on to the deadline by making a small purchase on the¬†Tesco Clubcard¬†site with the voucher or vouchers you have. The remaining balance of the voucher would then be credited back to your Clubcard account as points, reissued with newer expiry dates. This means that if you spend 50p on a ¬£10 voucher, you‚Äôll get ¬£9.50 as new vouchers. ¬† We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Money team?

Introducing: Ben Healy,https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/introducing-ben-healy/,,['Daniel Benson'],,"EF's Irish sensation on his road to the WorldTour, being dropped by British Cycling, and taking over the mantle from Roche and Martin","Image 1 of 6Ben Healy (Image credit: Ben Healy)Image 2 of 6Ben Healy (Image credit: Ben Healy)Image 3 of 6Ben Healy (Image credit: Ben Healy)Image 4 of 6Ben Healy (Image credit: Ben Healy)Image 5 of 6Ben Healy (Image credit: Ben Healy)Image 6 of 6Ben Healy (Image credit: Ben Healy) Ben Healy was almost out of options at the end of 2018 after being let go by the British Cycling mountain bike academy but the Irishman persevered and fought his way onto Team Wiggins and Trinity Racing.Since then, he has gone from strength to strength and, after two impressive years in U23 ranks, has been offered a contract in the WorldTour with EF Education-Nippo.The 21-year-old all-rounder sat down with Cyclingnews to talk about coming through the ranks, taking set-backs in his stride and a bright future at Jonathan Vaughters‚Äô American team.Cyclingnews: First and foremost, how did you get into cycling? Ben Healy: It was through my dad. He just took me down to the local outdoor track one day in Halesowen. He never really forced it on me but he took me along to some of the Sunday sessions and it just went from there. I enjoyed it and always wanted to keep going back. I was probably five years old and carried on with that by trying to qualify for national omniums but I was never very good at it. I quickly moved on from the track and actually got into mountain biking through my dad again. I started racing XC and then always used road alongside that. It wasn‚Äôt until I was a junior that I started to really focus on the road and leave mountain biking behind. More from the seriesIntroducing: Joe Pidcock Introducing: Veronica Ewers Introducing: Juan Ayuso Introducing: Niamh Fisher-Black CN: As a junior on the road you had some great results in France and Italy. How did you make that transition to racing abroad?BH: It was by pure chance really. When I was 16, I was dropped by the mountain bike academy at British Cycling and wasn‚Äôt sure where I was going to go next. On the mountain bike side, there wasn‚Äôt much support to get you out abroad and I needed to make that change to the road. So, either I was going to get on the academy or I had to move across to the road. I did that, and by chance, I had a friend going to the Zappi junior team. I sent my CV over, not really knowing the race calendar that they had but I got a place and from there it took me to my first international races. Good things come out of disappointment sometimes.CN: You were born in the UK but you‚Äôve been Irish champion in the road race and time trial in the last couple of years. Where does the Irish heritage arise from?BH: It‚Äôs all from my dad‚Äôs side. He wasn‚Äôt born there but his grandparents and brothers and sisters were from Cork, and they moved over from Ireland in the 1970s for work-related reasons. I felt it was a nice move for me and, if I‚Äôm completely honest, at first it was for the opportunities, but the family connection was there, and I do really feel like a part of Ireland now. That side of the family is proud of what I‚Äôve done, too - they all are obviously. I go back now and then, but not that often with racing.CN: How did you land a place on the Wiggins team in 2019?BH: My first year as a junior was pretty good, I guess, and then my second year wasn‚Äôt great. I was struggling for teams, and mid-way through the year, I got a half-decent result at the Internationale Juniorendriedaagse with a stage win and top-10 overall. As soon as I did that, I updated the CV, got it out there, and made contact with as many development teams as I could. Obviously, Wiggins was one of them but I was being declined by everyone else. I got to Worlds, the last race of the season, and I was thinking ‚Äòwhat am I doing here?‚Äô I still didn‚Äôt have any offers but Jamie Barlow, who is ex-Trinity now, was scouting for Wiggins there. We got chatting but he couldn‚Äôt guarantee me a place. It was only a couple of weeks after Worlds when he said the team could give me the opportunity. I was pretty lucky to get onto there.CN: Did you have a plan of what you were going to do if you hadn‚Äôt found a place in 2019? BH: I really don‚Äôt know to be honest. I definitely would have kept on riding, so I wouldn‚Äôt have just packed it in because even if had got that chance I would have still had some opportunities. I just wouldn‚Äôt have been on a top development team. At the same team I was doing my exams, there wasn‚Äôt much racing and I still had to fight my way through in a way. It wasn‚Äôt just like I arrived on a big team and all of a sudden I was at these big races. Nothing was made easy for me. So even if I didn‚Äôt get a place on Wiggins I still think that I would have found a way.CN: Was there a big breakout moment for you? Was it when you won the stage in the Tour de l‚ÄôAvenir or some of the results that you had previously?BH: The first time that I realised that I had the legs to compete with the top Under 23 riders was at Gent-Wevelgem at the start of the year in 2019. I think I was 11th but I had made the split. It wasn‚Äôt just from pure luck. I had ridden across to the front and then I was racing against these guys. In the final, I was just too aggressive and used my legs too early, but it was a good learning experience for me. I realised I was one of the strongest and that I can compete. That was one of my first U23 races and it did a lot for my confidence because I was able to tell myself that I could get only get better over the next couple of years. The stage at l'Avenir backed all of that up. Ben Healy (Image credit: Ben Healy) CN: Last year was tough with the lack of racing due to COVID but you still picked up a number of results, winning a stage at Ronde de l‚ÄôIsard and taking the national titles in road and the time trial.BH: I made the most of a bad situation, but it was still disappointing as I would have liked to have done a full year. Even this year we didn‚Äôt get a full season, but I‚Äôve gone into every race wanting to make the most of everything. I really went into each race wanting to get the best out of myself and learn as much as possible.CN: How did the move to EF Education-Nippo come about?BH: It started after Ronde de l‚ÄôIsard last year. I could have made the choice then to possibly move up. My agent Andrew McQuaid asked me what I wanted to do and I chose to say at U23 for another season. I first knew that EF were interested in me just before the Baby Giro and then after the race, I won a stage, put in a good showing, and they started to talk to us. I sat down with Andrew and I had some pretty good options in terms of where I could go. EF really stood out to me. I signed with them really because they wanted me so bad. They were interested in me before the Baby Giro and before the results I had that and that was really important for me.CN: Why did you decide to stay U23 for another season in 2021?BH: Last year wasn‚Äôt a full year and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd proved enough to even myself. I just don‚Äôt think that I was ready to step up to that WorldTour level. I‚Äôd spent the Baby Giro working for Tom [Pidcock] and I wasn‚Äôt sole leader on the team. I knew that I‚Äôd get that opportunity this year. I didn‚Äôt want to rush through things and I was confident that I would make it. It meant I could spend the year enjoying racing without the pressure, learn how to lead a team, and I feel that it was an important step in my development.CN: What sort of role will you have at EF and how excited are you about joining the team?BH: It‚Äôs pretty cool, and they‚Äôre definitely one of the faces of the peloton so I‚Äôm really excited to be going there. One of the reasons that I signed for them is because they‚Äôre really keen on developing me as a rider and sticking me into some big races as well. Hopefully, if I perform in them then I‚Äôll get further opportunities. They‚Äôve really got a good plan for me. I don‚Äôt have an exact calendar but when I spoke to them they mentioned the possibility of doing one of the bigger one-week races, which would be good. Healy in the break at the Tour of Britain this year (Image credit: SWpix.com) CN: Some people haven‚Äôt had a chance to see you race over the last two years. What sort of rider are you in terms of your results and where you want to progress?BH: I think that I‚Äôm a bit of an all-rounder, to be honest. I‚Äôm definitely one of the lighter guys but for the Classics it‚Äôs hard to say because I‚Äôve had that opportunity taken away from me for the last couple of years. When I have raced them, I‚Äôve done pretty well, though, as I feel like I can navigate a bunch pretty well and half the battle with the Classics is just that. I do enjoy them. Whether I‚Äôm a Classics rider, I‚Äôm not quite sure, but where I‚Äôve excelled is in the medium mountain days and maybe in the future I‚Äôll turn into a bit of a GC rider because I quite like a TT as well. I‚Äôm still finding out exactly where I will fit but I know my strengths and weaknesses. CN: Obviously there are some big names retiring this season with Dan Martin and Nicolas Roche hanging up their wheels. Those are big shoes to fill for Irish riders and you‚Äôre part of that next generation coming through. How does it feel, not to be measured against those guys, but to be part of that new waveBH: It‚Äôs cool. The spotlight is on me now. It‚Äôs a bit disappointing that I‚Äôm not going to race with those guys but I know them a bit and I hope I‚Äôve learned from them. I feel ready to do my best and represent Ireland to the best of my ability.CN: Outside of cycling, what are you into?BH: Cycling just takes up so much of my time and energy but I do like to switch off when I can. Nothing too exciting, just a bit of socializing with my friends, and I like going on walks. I just got a new puppy and have been looking after him a bit while I‚Äôve been at home. He‚Äôs boisterous and likes to run around a lot.CN: Where are you basing yourself next year?BH: That‚Äôs the next step that I need to make. I‚Äôm planning on moving to Girona. It just makes sense; the service course is there, it‚Äôs good for training and the heat. I‚Äôll live with Tom Gloag and and we‚Äôre moving out there together.

China to give COVID vaccine to children as young as 3,https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-covid-vaccine-children-young-3,,,,"Children as young as 3 will start receiving COVID-19 vaccines in China, where 76% of the population has been fully vaccinated and authorities are maintaining a zero-tolerance policy toward outbreaks.",,10/25/21 11:35,"close Video Morgan Ortagus: China tried to ‚Äòdeflect‚Äô COVID came from Wuhan Former State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus tells ‚ÄòFox & Friends Weekend‚Äô that the Chinese Communist Party has never taken accountability for the global pandemic. Children as young as 3 will start receiving COVID-19 vaccines in China , where 76% of the population has been fully vaccinated and authorities are maintaining a zero-tolerance policy toward outbreaks. Local city and provincial level governments in at least five provinces issued notices in recent days announcing that children ages 3-11 will be required to get their vaccinations. The expansion of the vaccination campaign comes as parts of China take new clampdown measures to try to stamp out small outbreaks. Gansu, a northwestern province heavily dependent on tourism, closed all tourist sites Monday after finding new COVID-19 cases. Residents in parts of Inner Mongolia have been ordered to stay indoors due to an outbreak there.

(AP Photo/Andy Wong) INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ‚ÄòCOMPLICIT‚Äô IN GAIN-OF-FUNCTION RESEARCH: BOOK The National Health Commission reported 35 new cases of local transmission had been detected over the past 24 hours, four of them in Gansu. Another 19 cases were found in the Inner Mongolia region, with others scattered around the country. China has employed lockdowns, quarantines and compulsory testing for the virus throughout the pandemic and has largely stamped out cases of local infection while fully vaccinating 1.07 billion people in its population of 1.4 billion. In particular, the government is concerned about the spread of the more contagious delta variant by travelers and about having a largely vaccinated public ahead of the Beijing Olympics in February. Overseas spectators already have been banned from the Games, and participants will have to stay in a bubble separating them from people outside. China's most widely used vaccines, from Sinopharm and Sinovac, have shown efficacy in preventing severe disease and transmission of the virus, based on public data. But the protection they offer against the delta variant has not been answered definitively, although officials say they remain protective. Residents wearing face masks to help curb the spread of the coronavirus gather at a vaccination site as they wait to receive booster shots against COVID-19 in Beijing on Monday. (AP Photo/Andy Wong) Hubei, Fujian and Hainan provinces all issued provincial level notices alerting new vaccination requirements, while individual cities in Zhejiang province and Hunan province have also issued similar announcements. China in June had approved two vaccines ‚Äî Sinopharm's from the Beijing Institute of Biological Products and Sinovac ‚Äî for children age 3-17, but it has only been vaccinating those 12 and older. In August, regulators approved another, Sinopharm's from the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products. After the vaccines received domestic approval for children in China, foreign governments began giving the shots to children in their own countries. Cambodia uses both Sinovac and Sinopharm‚Äôs shots in children 6-11. Regulators in Chile approved Sinovac for children as young as 6. In Argentina, regulators approved the Sinopharm vaccine for children as young as age 3. Many developing countries left out of the race to get shots from Western pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna bought Chinese vaccines. China has shipped more than 1.2 billion doses as of September, according to its Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Even with widespread domestic and global use, not every parent is reassured about the vaccine, citing less publicly available data on the shots. Wang Lu, who lives in the southern city of Fuzhou in Fujian province, said she isn‚Äôt particularly rushing to get her 3-year-old son vaccinated. ""I‚Äôm just not very clear on the vaccine‚Äôs safety profile, so I don‚Äôt really want to get him vaccinated, at the very least, I don‚Äôt want to be the first,"" Wang said. Sinovac started an efficacy trial with 14,000 child participants across multiple countries in September. Its approval in China was based on smaller phase 1 and phase 2 trials. Sinopharm‚Äôs Beijing shot was also approved based on smaller phase 1 and phase 2 trials. These were published later in peer-reviewed journals. Other parents said they weren‚Äôt concerned, given that many other people had already gotten the shot.

According to experts, the combination of vaccination and herd immunity has worked effectively and even played a significant role in keeping the numbers down this year. However, they have warned that asymptomatic cases may increase over the next few weeks in the city. According to a report published in the Times of India (TOI), this year, Kolkata recorded 1,382 Covid cases and 19 deaths in the week after the festival, whereas in 2020, the post-Puja week had witnessed 7,133 new Covid cases and 122 deaths. Around 3.4 lakh samples were tested for Covid-19 across Bengal in the week following Durga Puja last year. Meanwhile, a total of 2.1 lakh samples have been tested this year during post-Puja week, TOI revealed in its report. Vaccination status in Kolkata As per reports, 8.3 lakh people are completely vaccinated while another 47.4 lakh people have received their first dose in Kolkata. Meanwhile, CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar was quoted by TOI as saying that Covid cases in the city may rise more sharply in the upcoming weeks as the effects of public gatherings would be more evident. However, with numerous cases of asymptomatic patients, moderate to severe cases will be fewer this year, Dhar added. Notably, last year, it had taken over two months after the festivities for the Covid spike to gradually diminish. Overall vaccination prevented the spread or Covid transmission, TOI quoted Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) professor, Diptendra Sarkar as saying.

LexaGene is in the process of completing the necessary work to have the FDA rule on authorizing the MiQLab‚Ñ¢ for COVID-19 testing. The FDA is expected to classify the MiQLab as a class II medical device. As such, the process of preparing its point-of-care (POC) fully-automated PCR system, which is comprised of hardware, firmware, software, and chemistry, for evaluation by the FDA, is considerably more complex than if it were simply submitting only a COVID-19 PCR test chemistry for FDA authorization. Dr. Jack Regan, LexaGene‚Äôs CEO and Founder stated, ‚ÄúSuccessfully completing these studies is a big step for LexaGene, as these data could only be collected after we have sufficiently met a number of requirements for system/software verification, electrical safety testing, manufacturing process qualification, quality control, and the associated documentation. It is our belief that the quality of our data will meet FDA expectations. Our next step is to have a third party conduct a COVID-19 clinical evaluation using the MiQLab System at both a POC testing facility and a clinical laboratory, and then the analytical and clinical data will be compiled and submitted to the FDA for authorization.‚Äù The following analytical studies were completed using multiple MiQLab Systems: External Quality Control Validation Analytical Sensitivity: Limit of Detection (LoD) Analytical Specificity: Cross-Reactivity Endogenous Interference Substances Studies Carry-over/Cross-Contamination Study Sample Stability Dr. Regan continued, ‚ÄúThis milestone should be viewed as having much broader implications than COVID-19 testing only. Our goal is to get our technology through the FDA so that we can leverage the system‚Äôs high-quality sample preparation followed by broad-multiplex PCR analysis, which is a combination of features that many currently authorized COVID-19 only testing devices do not have. These features make the MiQLab ideally suited for syndromic testing of complex diseases that can be caused by 10 or more pathogens, such as respiratory diseases (e.g., COVID-19, influenza A & B, RSV, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, etc.), gastro-intestinal diseases, urinary tract diseases, and skin and soft tissue diseases. Preparing our technology to be able to successfully collect the analytical COVID-19 data is arguably the hardest step in the EUA process. If we are successful in being authorized for COVID-19 testing, we will follow this work with studies to support 510(k) applications for complex diseases in human clinical medicine.‚Äù LexaGene‚Äôs MiQLab system is unique in that it is a flow-through PCR system. To LexaGene‚Äôs knowledge, the FDA has never received an application for a flow-through PCR system for use in human clinical diagnostics. It is possible the FDA will require additional studies prior to passing final judgement. Once the required studies are complete, there is no guarantee the FDA will deem the data to be satisfactory for authorization of the system for human clinical diagnostics. Prior to the FDA‚Äôs ruling, all data and communications with the FDA are deemed private. Until the FDA grants LexaGene‚Äôs system EUA for COVID-19 testing, all work using LexaGene instruments is classified as Research Use Only and cannot be used for human clinical diagnostics.

"Fearing another Covid wave, China goes for strict lockdown in Ejin county",https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/world/china-goes-for-strict-lockdown-in-ejin-county-fearing-another-covid-wave-742125,,,,"Fearing another Covid wave, China has imposed lockdown-like restrictions in its Ejin county as the region has witnessed an increased number of cases of contagious disease.",,10/25/21 11:56,"Fearing another Covid wave, China has imposed lockdown-like restrictions in its Ejin county as the region has witnessed an increased number of cases of contagious disease. The county lies in the Mongolia region in the country where the administration has asked thousands of citizens to stay home and warned for civil and criminal action against those not following protocols, according to Bloomberg. In another development, a retired Chinese couple who tested positive for COVID-19, days after they went on a travel spree across the country, has been blamed for the latest spike in cases in the country, raising questions about the efficacy of China‚Äôs Zero-COVID policy. China on Friday reported 32 coronavirus cases, including four positive cases in Beijing, the spurt in the capital city causing a sense of disquiet among officials ahead of the winter Olympics early next year. Beijing has been reporting stray cases since Tuesday this week, ending the zero-case record for over two months. Critics say despite periodic outbreaks of infections in different parts of the country posing huge logistic challenges, China has shown no signs of relaxing its costly Zero-COVID policy. China‚Äôs National Health Commission, which releases daily updates of cases, said in its latest report that 28 new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases were reported on Thursday in different parts of the country. Separately, Beijing's health authorities reported four cases in the city. The places where the cases were reported included Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Guizhou and Qinghai. The current spike in cases was largely attributed to an elderly couple from Shanghai who flew to several cities, including the tourist city of Xian, tested positive for COVID-19, and sent officials on a leather hunt to trace scores of people who had come in contact with them. Within three days of an announcement that the couple had tested positive in Xian on Saturday, hundreds of close contacts of the couple and their five travel companions, who later tested positive, were identified. During this period, several cities had rolled out mass testing, a land port stopped operating and popular locations visited by the group were closed for disinfection, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported. Details of the group‚Äôs domestic flights and hotels, stops at roast duck restaurants and noodle shops, was reported by the official media, with people being asked to report whether their movements overlapped with them. Such cases causing periodic outbreaks presents considerable logistical and economic challenges to China despite administering vaccines to three quarters of its population. The inevitability of further cases and a waning of vaccine antibody levels beg the question of how long China should persist with the Zero-COVID policy, the Post report said on Friday. China, which unlike the rest of the world is seeking to pursue a zero case policy by stringently restricting foreign travel, faced increased criticism as the cases reported in smaller numbers continue to surface. Wherever the cases prop up, officials immediately begin testing thousands of people around the area, besides banning flights and trains to prevent local people from travelling. Beijing, where the foreign travel is strictly restricted with 21-day quarantine for foreigners, followed the stringent policy of zero cases as it gears up to host the prestigious Winter Olympics in February next year. China has restricted travel from India and a number of other countries. Despite numerous pleas, China has not permitted over 23,000 Indian students enrolled in Chinese colleges to return besides hundreds of Indians working in the country, stating that it is a preventive measure to contain the spread of the virus.

2 B.C. doctors linked to website selling bogus mask and vaccine exemption 'certificates',https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-enable-air-mask-vaccine-exemptions-1.6221825?cmp=rss,,['Bethany Lindsay'],,"A B.C. physician accused of spreading misinformation about COVID-19 is now under investigation for allegedly writing phoney mask and vaccine exemptions offered through a Kelowna-based website. That site, EnableAir.com, appears to be connected to another B.C. doctor.",,10/25/21 12:00,"A B.C. physician accused of spreading misinformation about COVID-19 is now under investigation for allegedly writing phoney mask and vaccine exemptions offered through a Kelowna-based website. CBC News has obtained a four-page ""declaration certificate of medical exemption including psychosocial conditions"" that was purportedly signed by Dr. Stephen Malthouse and produced through a service called EnableAir.com. That website appears to be connected to another B.C. doctor, Dr. Gwyllyn Goddard, whose medical licence is temporarily inactive. A copy of the same certificate has been sent to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C. and they are investigating, CBC has confirmed. A spokesperson for B.C.'s Health Ministry did not answer direct questions about EnableAir.com, but confirmed there is no such thing as an exemption certificate for either masks or vaccines. EnableAir.com promises ""authentic medical exemptions,"" including QR codes, for people who are ""concerned with totalitarian mainstream narratives,"" and advertises the services of five unnamed Canadian physicians. It's not clear how much the service costs, but the website warns prospective customers to "" mentally prepare for the invoice ."" Audio Divorced Sask. parents fight in court over COVID-19 vaccination for teen daughter The certificate allegedly signed by Malthouse includes a two-page preamble invoking the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Constitution, the UN's Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights and the Nuremberg Code. It doesn't offer any specifics about why the bearer should be exempted from mask and vaccine mandates, but offers a long list of possible reasons, including vaccine allergies but also HIV, autism, ""impaired social development,"" asthma, eczema, migraines and ""personal belief."" Doctor already faces discipline related to COVID-19 The contact information displayed on the certificate obtained by CBC matches publicly listed contact information for Goddard. The Kelowna post office box is connected to his cannabis consulting firm , CanaBC Services Ltd., and the fax number is listed on his personal website . Goddard did not respond to emailed questions or text messages, and hung up on a reporter when contacted by phone. The full contents of EnableAir.com were taken offline within hours of that phone call. B.C. doctor disciplined for 'harmful' COVID-19 misinformation claims free speech violations Neither Malthouse nor his lawyer, Rocco Galati of Toronto, responded to questions about the certificate. EnableAir.com advertises that 50 per cent of ""post-administrative fees"" will be donated to Galati and the Constitutional Rights Centre, an organization he founded. However, Galati told CBC he has no connection to the website. Dr. Stephen Malthouse appeared at a rally against COVID-19 restrictions in Duncan, B.C., last November, referring to the disease as a 'so-called pandemic.' (YouTube) Malthouse, a family doctor on Denman Island, is already the subject of disciplinary proceedings at the college as well as complaints from at least 10 other physicians. Over the last year, he's appeared at several rallies against pandemic-related measures, falsely claiming that COVID-19 is no more deadly than the flu and that vaccines are more dangerous. His musings have gone viral online. According to a petition Malthouse filed in B.C. Supreme Court in June, he faces a reprimand from the college, which wants to bar him from speaking on issues related to COVID-19. Malthouse has asked the court to block those measures, arguing they're an infringement on his right to free speech. Doctors 'need to provide objective medical evidence' College registrar Dr. Heidi Oetter said she couldn't comment on any investigations into Malthouse or EnableAir.com, but the college has a standard for what's expected of any doctor writing exemptions. ""It's very clear about the need to provide objective medical evidence. You can't simply restate something just because the patient wants you to do that,"" she said. ""If somebody is signing a letter that is inconsistent with those expectations, they may face an investigation by the college and, if warranted, regulatory action."" The college posted a notice last week in response to reports of fraudulent exemption letters circulating in the province. It includes guidance for businesses or employers about how to identify a valid exemption. In B.C., proof of vaccination is required to access many non-essential services, and there are very few valid exemptions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) There's a very short list of acceptable reasons for an exemption or deferral from a COVID-19 vaccine, including a history of anaphylactic reactions to both mRNA vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, and adenovirus vector vaccines like AstraZeneca. Ontario's College of Physicians and Surgeons has barred three doctors from issuing mask and vaccine exemptions in recent weeks. A spokesperson for that college said he couldn't comment on any possible connection to EnableAir.com. B.C. doctors urge action on colleague spreading COVID-19 misinformation Ontario doctor accused of spreading COVID-19 misinformation barred from providing vaccine, mask exemptions But one of those physicians, Dr. Patrick Phillips , has promoted EnableAir.com on social media . Another has a B.C. connection ‚Äî Dr. Rochagne Kilian previously worked in Williams Lake, and held a medical licence in this province from 2009 to 2014. Oetter said while the rules are slightly different in B.C., similar restrictions could be placed on doctors here if evidence suggested they were providing fraudulent exemptions.

(Daneil Mihailescu/AFP/Getty Images) As of early Monday morning, more than 243.7 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University's coronavirus tracking tool. The reported global death toll stood at more than 4.9 million. In Europe , the Romanian government will re-introduce a night curfew and make health passes mandatory for entry to most public venues from Monday. Meanwhile, Russia reported another daily record of confirmed coronavirus cases Monday as a surge in infections has prompted the Kremlin to tell most people to stay away from work starting later this week. The Russian government's coronavirus task force tallied 37,930 new confirmed cases in 24 hours, the highest number since the start of the pandemic. The task force also reported 1,069 more COVID-19 deaths in the same period, slightly fewer than a record of 1,075 reached over the weekend. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russians not to go to work between Oct. 30 and Nov. 7, when the country will observe an extended holiday. During that time, most state organizations and private businesses, except for those operating key infrastructure and a few others, are to halt work. In the Asia-Pacific region, children as young as three will start receiving COVID-19 vaccines in China, where 76 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated and authorities are maintaining a zero-tolerance policy toward outbreaks. Local city and provincial level governments in at least five provinces issued notices in recent days announcing that children ages three to 11 will be required to get their vaccinations. INTERACTIVE | Where is the coronavirus pandemic getting better or worse? The expansion of the vaccination campaign comes as parts of China bring in new measures to try to stamp out small outbreaks. Gansu, a northwestern province heavily dependent on tourism, closed all tourist sites Monday after finding new COVID-19 cases. Residents in parts of Inner Mongolia have been ordered to stay indoors due to an outbreak there. The National Health Commission reported 35 new cases of local transmission had been detected over the past 24 hours, four of them in Gansu. Another 19 cases were found in the Inner Mongolia region, with others scattered around the country. In Papua New Guinea, concerted international action is needed as a surge in COVID-19 cases overwhelms the Pacific country's health system, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said on Monday. Meanwhile, South Korea said it has achieved its goal of vaccinating 70 per cent of its 52 million people, paving the way for a planned return to normal next month. In the Middle East , in the United Arab Emirates, health officials on Monday reported one additional death and 97 new cases of COVID-19. In the Americas , White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci said Americans can choose a booster shot that is different from their original inoculation ‚Äî but the recommendation is to stick with the vaccine they got first if it is available. In Africa , Tunisia imposed COVID-19 vaccine passes on Tunisians and all foreign visitors. Officials, employees and users are required to show their vaccine pass to access public and private administrations. -From Reuters, The Associated Press and CBC News, last updated at 10:35 a.m. ET",,cbc
U.N. reports record greenhouse gas levels despite COVID shutdowns,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/greenhouse-gas-emmissions-un-warns-record-concentrations-cop26/,,,,"World Meteorological Organization warns data show mankind ""way off track"" if it wants to stop ""skidding into a car crash"" of climate disaster.",,10/25/21 12:16,"Geneva ‚Äî Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere reached new record levels last year, the United Nations said on Monday in a stark warning ahead of the COP26 summit about worsening global warming . The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin from the UN's World Meteorological Organization said the annual rate of increase last year was above the yearly average between 2011 and 2020 ‚Äî and the trend continued in 2021. The WMO said the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a temporary decline in new emissions, but had no discernible impact on the atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases and their growth rates. How climate change is hurting your health The organization said that as long as emissions continue, global temperatures will continue to rise. And given the long life of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, the temperature level already observed will persist for several decades even if emissions are rapidly reduced to net zero. White House wants climate action before COP26... 06:42 COP26, the UN Climate Change Conference, is being held in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12. ""The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin contains a stark, scientific message for climate change negotiators at COP26,"" said WMO chief Petteri Taalas. ""At the current rate of increase in greenhouse gas concentrations , we will see a temperature increase by the end of this century far in excess of the Paris Agreement targets of 1.5 to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. ""We are way off track."" The greenhouse gases The three major greenhouses gases are CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. CO2 is the most important, accounting for around 66% of the warming effect on the climate. U.S. intel chiefs warn climate change will ""exacerbate risks"" U.N.'s warning on climate change 09:36 CO2 concentrations reached 413.2 parts per million in 2020, up 2.5 ppm, and is at 149% of the 1750 pre-industrial level, the WMO said. The report said that roughly half of the CO2 emitted by human activity remains in the atmosphere, with the other half ending up in the oceans and the land. ""The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3C warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters [yards] higher than now. But there weren't 7.8 billion people then,"" said Taalas. Methane averages reached a new high of 1,889 parts per billion in 2020, up 11ppb on the year before, and is at 262% of the pre-industrial benchmark. Study looks at cattle methane emissions 05:16 Around 40% of methane is emitted from natural sources such as wetlands, while 60% comes from human activity, including rice agriculture and landfills. Nitrous oxide averages reached 333.2 ppb, up 1.2 ppb, at 123 percent of 1750 levels. Need to ""revisit"" our ""whole way of life"" The WMO said that with continued rising greenhouse gas emissions, alongside rising temperatures, the planet could also expect more weather extremes. That includes intense heat and rainfall, ice melt, sea-level rise and ocean acidification ‚Äî all of which will have far-reaching socio-economic impacts. Climate deal faces challenges over spending 06:43 ""We need to transform our commitment into action that will have an impact on the gases that drive climate change,"" said Taalas. ""We need to revisit our industrial, energy and transport systems and whole way of life. The needed changes are economically affordable and technically possible. There is no time to lose."" Euan Nisbet, from the University of London's Greenhouse Gas Group, compared greenhouse gas measurements to ""skidding into a car crash."" ""The disaster gets closer and closer but you can't stop it. You can clearly see the crash ahead, and all you can do is howl.""

Maharashtra flags off Covid-19 vaccination drive for college students,https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/maharashtra-covid-vaccination-drive-college-students-october-november-1869186-2021-10-25?utm_source=rss,,,,Maharashtra flags off Covid-19 vaccination drive for college students,,10/25/21 12:16,"The Maharashtra government has planned a vaccination drive for college students above the age of 18. It began on October 25 and will end on November 2. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said that youngsters need to be vaccinated urgently because they are the ones that travel the most. He added that the colleges that perform well in the inoculation drive will be rewarded. Colleges in Maharashtra reopened on October 20 after the pandemic situation improved in the state. However, college students need to be fully vaccinated before they are allowed to attend offline classes. Hence, colleges are still running online classes since many students are not fully vaccinated yet. There are nearly 40 lakh college students across Maharashtra, including those pursuing higher education, technical education, medical studies and those enrolled in non-affiliated and private colleges. COVID SITUATION IN MAHARASHTRA So far, Maharashtra has administered 9,51,65,513 Covid-19 vaccine doses . Nearly 3 crore people have been fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, 1,410 new Covid-19 cases were registered in 24 hours in Maharashtra on Sunday. There are 23,894 active patients across the state at present.

How did California go from COVID-19 epicenter to lowest statewide transmission rate?,https://6abc.com/california-covid-19-infection-rate-vaccination-requirements-vaccine-mandates/11165638/,,['ABCNews'],https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/wpvi/102521-wpvi-covid-vaccine-GMA-vid.mp4,"""We can't know for sure which factors are responsible,"" an epidemiologist said, ""but we know that the combination of interventions and policies can play a really strong role in driving transmission.""",,10/25/21 12:21,"LOS ANGELES -- With the lowest COVID-19 infection rate among all states as of Friday, California, which has some of the strictest mask and vaccination mandates in the country, has managed to flip the script as the former U.S. epicenter of the pandemic. ""They've been very much forward-thinking in terms of policies around vaccination requirements and mandates,"" said epidemiologist Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor. As of Friday evening, California had an infection rate of 61.1 cases per 100,000 over the past week, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state was briefly the only to be classified with a ""moderate"" rate of transmission -- 10 to 49.99 cases per 100,000 over seven days -- before it went back up to ""substantial,"" meaning 50 to 99.99 cases per 100,000 over seven days. Over the previous week, Hawaii, Florida, Louisiana, Connecticut, New Jersey, Mississippi, Maryland, Georgia and Washington, D.C., each also reported ""substantial"" rates. A rate of at least 100 cases per 100,000 is labeled as ""high."" Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Alaska, as of Friday, had the highest rates over the previous seven days, with each above 450 cases per 100,000 people. The U.S. average over that span was 150.9. Experts said California's journey from worst to first is likely due to a combination of things. ""We can't know for sure which factors are responsible,"" Brownstein added, ""but we know that the combination of interventions and policies can play a really strong role in driving transmission."" 'Ending this pandemic' More than 70% of California's population has received at least one dose of vaccine, according to the CDC , and the state also leads in total vaccinations administered, roughly 53 million doses. As of Friday, the national average rate was 66.2%. Being the first state to announce a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for schools, California has some of the strictest mandates in the U.S. The state has mandated vaccines for state employees, health care workers, teachers and at large indoor gatherings. ""The more aggressive the vaccination campaign, the better,"" Dr. Todd Ellerin, director of infectious diseases at South Shore Health, told ABC News. Given that vaccines are the most powerful tool we have in curbing the spread of COVID-19, experts said they believe California's emphasis on immunizations has provided big dividends. ""These results show quite clearly that vaccines offer protection for individuals who lack immunity, with important implications for finally ending this pandemic,"" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, wrote in a blog post Tuesday. Idaho and Wyoming have some of the lowest vaccination rates and the highest transmission rates. All three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. have since shown high effectiveness in preventing death due to COVID-19, and as of Friday, California boasted the lowest death rate in the country, with 0.3 per 100,000 over the previous week. The U.S. average over that span was 2.7 per 100,000. Additionally, experts told ABC News, having endured the harshest waves of infections last winter and the delta surge in July, formerly infected Californians may have acquired antibodies and more of a natural immunity to COVID-19 -- both factors that, in concert with vaccines, could be driving down case numbers. 'More work to do' In addition to strict vaccine mandates, California has been unwavering on face-coverings, testing and social distancing policies. ""While California has administered more vaccines than any other state, we have more work to do,"" the California Department of Public Health said in a statement to ABC News. Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, is required to wear a mask on public transit, in health care settings and at educational and correctional facilities. Masks are required for all unvaccinated people and recommended for vaccinated people in settings such as theaters, retail stores, restaurants and bars. Despite having a higher vaccination rate than California, states like Vermont are still falling behind on transmission rate rankings, which experts said points to the importance of distancing and masking. Breakthrough cases seen in Vermont can be further explained by its higher proportion of residents 65 and older. Mobility Research shows mobility, or movement in populations, can be a predictor of disease spread, especially via air travel or mass transit. This became evident through the surge of COVID-19 cases the U.S. saw during holiday season. Gov. Gavin Newsom pleaded with California residents on Christmas Eve to avoid holiday gatherings at a time when hospitals in the state were under ""unprecedented pressure."" Californian cities experienced a huge surge of cases and hospitalizations following the holidays, although rates have since declined. No stranger to stay-at-home orders, the California government imposed several lockdowns and restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. It celebrated its most recent reopening in mid-June, which replaced 15-month-long public health restrictions with conditions more akin to ""business as usual."" ""In the height of the pandemic, people were locked down, they weren't moving at all, they were staying at home,"" Brownstein told ABC News. ""The more people move around, that's usually an indicator for increased transmission."" The great outdoors The virus has been shown to spread more indoors and with people in close proximity to one another. California's sunny climate means more people spend more time outside. ""When we spend most of our time indoors, that's when transmission is greatest,"" Ellerin said. Added Brownstein: ""More close contacts with people outside your household indoors is what creates additional risk."" This effect is also compounded by the rise in the virus' effective reproductive number during the winter season with research suggesting that a drop in temperature encourages virus growth. Compared to many other states, especially as winter draws nearer, California is in ""quite a good spot,"" Brownstein said. ""In all likelihood, the trends that we're seeing are realistic and very much driven by compliance with masking and other interventions, plus the well-covered vaccination strategy in the state.""

Q&A: Should we be concerned about the new Covid-19 ‚ÄòDelta Plus‚Äô variant?,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/q-a-should-we-be-concerned-about-the-new-covid-19-delta-plus-variant-1.4710018?localLinksEnabled=false,,['Simon Carswell'],,A relative of the dominant Delta coronavirus variant is being monitored closely,,10/25/21 12:29,"A subvariant of the Delta strain of Covid-19, the more transmissible mutation of the coronavirus now in widespread circulation, is under investigation. But the fact that it has not officially been given a letter of the Greek alphabet of its own is a sign that it just being watched for now. What is the ‚ÄòDelta Plus‚Äô variant? The variant, known by its scientific identity AY.4.2, is a relative of the Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2 and first identified in India last October. Delta is now the dominant strain globally. The subvariant has new mutations in the spike protein, helping the virus invade the body‚Äôs cells. Is it a more dangerous version of the virus? There is no evidence to suggest that it causes more severe illness or greater mortality than the Delta variant or that it can escape the protection afforded by Covid-19 vaccines but scientists think that it might be more contagious, helping the virus spread more easily than earlier versions. So how transmissible could it be? Two scientific experts ‚Äì Jeffrey Barrett , director of the Covid-19 Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge, and Francois Balloux , director of the University College London Genetics Institute ‚Äì have said that it seems to be 10 to 15 per cent more transmissible than the original Delta variant. Early evidence suggests it has increased the growth rate in the UK. How does that compare with past variants? The Delta variant was 60 per cent more transmissible than the Alpha variant first identified in the UK in the second half of 2020 that caused Ireland‚Äôs third and worst wave of the pandemic. Alpha was itself 50 per cent more transmissible than the original virus that spread from China . Are scientists concerned? It is more a case of watching anxiously rather than being actively concerned. The UK Health Security Agency has moved the ‚ÄòDelta Plus‚Äô variant into ‚Äúvariant under investigation‚Äù category but it is not yet considered a ‚Äúvariant of concern‚Äù, the highest risk category for variants which would result in Delta Plus receiving its own letter of the Greek alphabet. Scientists are still checking evidence to see how AY.4.2 is behaving and whether it should be a cause of concern. Viruses evolve naturally and the AY.4.2 is one of 45 ‚Äúsub-lineages‚Äù descended from the Delta variant. Could it take off? The scientists who have investigated the strain say that it presents nothing like the challenge posed by the Alpha and Delta variants because the increase in transmissibility is not of the same scale and a small rise in transmissibility would not change the nature of the pandemic. Where is the ‚ÄòDelta Plus‚Äô variant? Most cases appear to be in the UK but it is still the minority variant there. A small number of cases have been reported in Denmark , Germany , the US, Israel and Russia . Cases of the variant have actually fallen in Denmark. The UK is the only country where it has risen in frequency, accounting for 6 per cent of all strains sequenced where the make-up of the virus is identified. Have any cases been detected in Ireland? Yes, Dr Cillian De Gascun , the director of UCD‚Äôs National Virus Reference Laboratory, has said that more than 80 cases have been identified here in sequencing. The variant is still rare: in September, it accounted for less than 2 per cent of more than 4,000 Covid-19 cases checked. What more is being done about it here? Dr De Gascun said that the laboratory will go back and investigate the ‚ÄòDelta Plus‚Äô cases to see where they were in the country and what age groups the variant infected ‚Äì and whether the variant led to more severe disease in the people affected. The objective of the investigation is to tease out more about how the sub variant is behaving. That exercise is likely to take a few weeks.",https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4710017.1635164952!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg,irishtimes

Read Full Article at RT.com","The Russian government has been told to introduce a ban on bars, clubs, and restaurants opening into the night as part of measures designed to bring down a nationwide spike in coronavirus infections and a record spate of deaths. In a list of instructions signed by President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, senior officials were ordered to introduce a range of new public health measures. Among them was ‚Äúthe introduction of a ban on the holding of entertainment and events, and the provision of hospitality services in the evening and at night.‚Äù According to the directive, venues will have to close between 11pm and 6am each day. The government now has until November 30 to report back to the Kremlin, after which the provisions will be reviewed on a monthly basis. A number of Russian regions introduced similar provisions at the beginning of the year to deal with a sharp rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, and both Moscow and St. Petersburg again trialed similar measures over the summer, before scrapping the restrictions entirely.

At least 1,069 people are said to have died over the same time period, which is close to the all-time high recorded last week. Putin has already signed off on a plan to extend national holidays, with a number of regions telling workers to stay home with full pay for at least an extra week.

How did California go from COVID-19 epicenter to lowest statewide transmission rate?,https://abc30.com/california-covid-19-infection-rate-vaccination-requirements-vaccine-mandates/11165638/,,['ABCNews'],,"""We can't know for sure which factors are responsible,"" an epidemiologist said, ""but we know that the combination of interventions and policies can play a really strong role in driving transmission.""",,10/25/21 12:40,"LOS ANGELES -- With the lowest COVID-19 infection rate among all states as of Friday, California, which has some of the strictest mask and vaccination mandates in the country, has managed to flip the script as the former U.S. epicenter of the pandemic. ""They've been very much forward-thinking in terms of policies around vaccination requirements and mandates,"" said epidemiologist Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor. As of Friday evening, California had an infection rate of 61.1 cases per 100,000 over the past week, according to from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state was briefly the only to be classified with a ""moderate"" rate of transmission -- 10 to 49.99 cases per 100,000 over seven days -- before it went back up to ""substantial,"" meaning 50 to 99.99 cases per 100,000 over seven days. Over the previous week, Hawaii, Florida, Louisiana, Connecticut, New Jersey, Mississippi, Maryland, Georgia and Washington, D.C., each also reported ""substantial"" rates. A rate of at least 100 cases per 100,000 is labeled as ""high."" Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Alaska, as of Friday, had the highest rates over the previous seven days, with each above 450 cases per 100,000 people. The U.S. over that span was 150.9. Experts said California's journey from worst to is likely due to a combination of things. ""We can't know for sure which factors are responsible,"" Brownstein added, ""but we know that the combination of interventions and policies can play a really strong role in driving transmission."" More than 70% of California's population has received at least one dose of vaccine, , and the state also leads in total vaccinations administered, roughly 53 million doses. As of Friday, the national average rate was 66.2%. Being the first state to announce a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for schools, California has some of the strictest mandates in the U.S. The state has mandated vaccines for state employees, health care workers, teachers and at large indoor gatherings. ""The more aggressive the vaccination campaign, the better,"" Dr. Todd Ellerin, director of infectious diseases at South Shore Health, told ABC News. Given that vaccines are the most powerful tool we have in curbing the spread of COVID-19, experts said they believe California's emphasis on immunizations has provided big dividends. ""These results show quite clearly that vaccines offer protection for individuals who lack immunity, with important implications for finally ending this pandemic,"" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, wrote in a Tuesday. Idaho and Wyoming have some of the lowest vaccination rates and the highest transmission rates. All three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. have since shown high effectiveness in preventing death due to COVID-19, and as of Friday, California the lowest death rate in the country, with 0.3 per 100,000 over the previous week. The U.S. average over that span was 2.7 per 100,000. Additionally, experts told ABC News, having endured the harshest waves of infections last winter and the delta surge in July, formerly infected Californians may have acquired antibodies and more of a natural immunity to COVID-19 -- both factors that, in concert with vaccines, could be driving down case numbers. In addition to strict vaccine mandates, California has been unwavering on face-coverings, testing and social distancing policies. ""While California has administered more vaccines than any other state, we have more work to do,"" the California Department of Public Health said in a statement to ABC News. Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, is to wear a mask on public transit, in health care settings and at educational and correctional facilities. Masks are required for all unvaccinated people and recommended for vaccinated people in settings such as theaters, retail stores, restaurants and bars. Despite having a higher vaccination rate than California, states like Vermont are still falling behind on transmission rate rankings, which experts said points to the importance of distancing and masking. Breakthrough cases seen in Vermont can be further explained by its higher proportion of residents 65 and older. shows mobility, or movement in populations, can be a predictor of disease spread, especially via air travel or mass transit. This became evident through the surge of COVID-19 cases the U.S. saw during holiday season. Gov. Gavin Newsom with California residents on Christmas Eve to avoid holiday gatherings at a time when hospitals in the state were under ""unprecedented pressure."" Californian cities a huge surge of cases and hospitalizations following the holidays, although rates have since declined. No stranger to stay-at-home orders, the California government imposed several lockdowns and restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. It celebrated its most recent reopening in mid-June, which replaced 15-month-long public health restrictions with conditions more akin to ""business as usual."" ""In the height of the pandemic, people were locked down, they weren't moving at all, they were staying at home,"" Brownstein told ABC News. ""The more people move around, that's usually an indicator for increased transmission."" The virus has been shown to spread more indoors and with people in close proximity to one another. California's sunny climate means more people spend more time outside. ""When we spend most of our time indoors, that's when transmission is greatest,"" Ellerin said. Added Brownstein: ""More close contacts with people outside your household indoors is what creates additional risk."" This effect is also compounded by the rise in the virus' effective reproductive number during the winter season with research that a drop in temperature encourages virus growth. Compared to many other states, especially as winter draws nearer, California is in ""quite a good spot,"" Brownstein said. ""In all likelihood, the trends that we're seeing are realistic and very much driven by compliance with masking and other interventions, plus the well-covered vaccination strategy in the state.""",,abc30

So, Sheeran has been and will likely remain in London for the time being. The U.K.'s National Health System says those with COVID-19 symptoms should receive a PCR test and those without symptoms can receive a rapid test. In either case, if the test comes back positive, you are meant to self-isolate. There are covid-related travel restrictions in place for those traveling between the U.S. and the U.K. Currently, the CDC classifies the U.K. as a level four ‚Äì or a country with a very high level of COVID-19. Most British nationals who have been in the U.K., Ireland, the Schengen zone, Iran, Brazil, China, South Africa or India within 14 days are not permitted to enter the U.S., according to the U.K. travel guidance , though there are some exceptions.

A few months ago, it re-emerged . Now, things are getting very lively. Hertz has ordered 100,000 Teslas, while also paying 7-time Super Bowl champ Tom Brady some enormous amount of money (I presume) to help drum up attention and business. Image courtesy of Hertz. Many of us who were looking at the Tesla Model 3 when it came to market and production scaled up assumed that the car would be a popular choice for rental car companies. However, it seems that early reliability concerns and probably other matters kept the rental car companies at bay and we seldom saw a company add a Tesla to its fleet. Sometimes all you need is time. With Tesla having established itself as a company, as a global producer, and as the world‚Äôs #1 electric vehicle seller at a time when EV sales are booming, it is simply a logical choice for a company like Hertz that wants to get more EVs in its fleets. As one of our helpful readers just pointed out to me, 100,000 cars is more than all the non-Tesla EVs sold in the US in the first three quarters of this year. To put Hertz‚Äôs order of 100,000 Model 3s in perspective, it is more than ALL EVs sold in the US by ALL manufacturers other than Tesla from Jan-Sept 2021 $tsla https://t.co/eLxhBY9b8Y pic.twitter.com/1M0PygtbAv ‚Äî Not_an_Analyst (@facts_tesla) October 25, 2021 The order is supposed to be fulfilled by the end of 2022. The first Tesla rental cars will be available in major US markets and select European cities starting in November. But how big is the Hertz vehicle fleet? Is this a significant effort? It sure is. These 100,000 Teslas will mean that 20% of the Hertz vehicle fleet will be electric. EVs are expected to be available in 65 Hertz markets by the end of 2022 and 100 markets by the end of 2023. The company is also investing in EV charging infrastructure (as one would do) to support all of those EVs at their home parking spaces (presumably, often at airports). The company says it is installing thousands of chargers. The Growing EV Market ‚ÄúElectric vehicles are now mainstream, and we‚Äôve only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,‚Äù said Hertz interim CEO Mark Fields . ‚ÄúThe new Hertz is going to lead the way as a mobility company, starting with the largest EV rental fleet in North America and a commitment to grow our EV fleet and provide the best rental and recharging experience for leisure and business customers around the world.‚Äù Without a doubt, requests from people renting cars from Hertz must have gone up noticeably in the past couple of years. Millions more electric vehicles have been sold, and Tesla itself has sold around 2 million. Furthermore, survey after survey shows people are curious about electric vehicles and considering buying one, and renting one for a few days is an ideal way to see how that would work for you. ‚ÄúToday, 40 percent of U.S. consumers say they are likely to consider an electric vehicle the next time they are in the market for a new vehicle, according to Pew,‚Äù Hertz writes. ‚ÄúGlobal EV sales skyrocketed 200 percent in the last year and will likely continue to grow with commitments from global automakers to increase EV sales. For example, in August, three U.S. automakers pledged to boost EV sales to 40-50 percent by 2030.‚Äù Hertz will offer a premium and differentiated rental experience for the Tesla EVs. This includes digitized guidance to educate customers about the electric vehicle to get them on their way quickly, and coming soon, an expedited EV rental booking process through the Hertz mobile app. You can go to hertz.com/ev to learn more. Naturally, with the EV market going up fast, the fossil fuel vehicle market is on its way down. That comes with big costs and risks that a company like Hertz has to think about.

Here‚Äôs the info on that: ‚ÄúTo spread the word about its leadership on EV rentals, Hertz is partnering with seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady for a new ‚ÄòHertz, Let‚Äôs Go!‚Äô campaign. ‚ÄúTwo new ads ‚Äì ‚ÄòPlugged In‚Äô and ‚ÄòSpeed‚Äô ‚Äì beginning today show Brady renting, recharging and using an EV at a Hertz airport location. The spots use humor and Brady‚Äôs signature ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs Go‚Äô game-day rallying cry to underscore Hertz‚Äôs reputation for excellence, speed and ease throughout the travel experience. ‚Äú‚ÄòHertz is changing the game when it comes to the future of mobility and has come through for me time and time again,‚Äô said Tom Brady . ‚ÄòAlthough the company has been around for over 100 years, their constant evolution, especially now, is something that is amazing to be a part of. I‚Äôve been driving an EV for years and knowing Hertz is leading the way with their electric fleet speaks to how the world is changing and the way companies are approaching being environmentally and socially conscious.

Medics in North ‚Äòvery concerned‚Äô ahead of easing of Covid-19 rules,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/medics-in-north-very-concerned-ahead-of-easing-of-covid-19-rules-1.4710055?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"Medics have expressed concern ahead of the further relaxation of coronavirus regulations in Northern Ireland while infection rates remain high. Nightclubs are to be allowed to reopen on Sunday for the first time since the start of lockdown, and social distancing in pubs and restaurants will be reduced to guidance. Daily infection rates have remained above 1,000 since July, and hospitals have in the past week been at more than 100 per cent occupancy. On Monday, four further coronavirus-related deaths and 1,019 new Covid-19 cases were reported by the North‚Äôs Department of Health. On Monday morning, there were 348 Covid-positive patients in hospital, of whom 33 were in intensive care. Dr Frances O‚ÄôHagan from the British Medical Association said medics are ‚Äúvery concerned‚Äù, and expressed her condolences to the families of the more than 30 people who have died with Covid-19 in the last week. She has advocated the use of Covid-19 vaccination passports, which has divided the Stormont Executive, with Ministers unable to agree to make them mandatory in hospitality venues. ‚ÄúWe as medics are very concerned about the situation that is facing us at the minute,‚Äù she told the BBC Radio Ulster‚Äôs Stephen Nolan Show. ‚ÄúIn both our hospitals and in our primary care we are really, really stretched.

She recognizes the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, but said she also understands her son is at a much lower risk for serious illness than older adults. ‚ÄúTo me it's not a clear benefit,‚Äù she said. While many parents were overjoyed at the news that Health Canada is considering approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine for kids age five to 11 in Canada, parents like Hubert are feeling more trepidatious, and public health officials said they are going to have a much more nuanced conversation with parents about vaccination than they did with adults. While 82 per cent of eligible Canadians aged 12 and up are already fully vaccinated, a recent survey by Angus Reid shows only 51 per cent of parents plan to immediately vaccinate their kids when a pediatric dose becomes available. Of parents with children in the five to 11 year age range, 23 per cent said they would never give their kids a COVID-19 vaccine, 18 per cent said they would wait, and nine per cent said they weren‚Äôt sure, according to the survey of 5,011 Canadians between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online surveys are not considered random samples. ‚ÄúMost of the research that I've seen sort of indicates that parents are more hesitant to vaccinate their kids against COVID than themselves,‚Äù said Kate Allan, a post-doctoral fellow at the Centre for Vaccine-Preventable Diseases at the University of Toronto. There are several reasons parents might pause, she said. It‚Äôs true that children are at a much lower risk of serious outcomes associated with COVID-19, and there have been very rare incidents of mRNA vaccines like Pfizer or Moderna linked to cases of myocarditis, a swelling of the heart muscle. As of Oct. 1, Health Canada has documented 859 cases associated with the vaccines, which mainly seem to affect people under 40 years old, and people who‚Äôve developed the complication have typically been fine. ‚ÄúI know it's rare, I know it's not deadly, but I also see the risk of severe symptoms from COVID as being rare and not deadly for Jackson,‚Äù Hubert said when asked about weighing up the risks and benefits of the vaccine. But public health experts stress that some children do suffer from rare but serious impacts from COVID-19, which can also cause myocarditis as well as the little-understood impacts of the condition known as long COVID. They say parents should consider the less tangible benefits of vaccination as well. ‚ÄúIt's less of a conversation about a direct benefit to them, and more of a community benefit,‚Äù Allan said. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on children, depriving them of school, time with their peers, extracurriculars ‚Äî and their mental health has suffered as a result, said Dr. Vinita Dubey, associate medical officer of health with Toronto Public Health. ‚ÄúNot one child has been spared from this pandemic. I mean every single child has had to bear a sacrifice because of the pandemic in one way or the other,‚Äù Dubey said. So far Pfizer-BioNtech is the only manufacturer to request approval for its pediatric COVID-19 vaccine and Health Canada is still reviewing the data. The regulator has promised the review will be thorough, and the vaccine will only be approved for children if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Policy-makers know they‚Äôre going to have to take parents' concerns seriously as well. On a recent tour of the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with Dr. Anne Pham-Huy, a pediatric infectious diseases physician. ‚ÄúVaccine confidence is going to be the most important part of it this time around,‚Äù Pham-Huy said, to which Trudeau agreed. Dubey has published research on improving parents‚Äô vaccine confidence when it comes to long-established inoculations like mumps and rubella. While she offered several tips, they mainly come down to building trust. Her research focused on the role of family doctors, but she said during the pandemic anyone can be that trusted sounding board. ‚ÄúIt could be a faith leader, it could be an important family member or friend, someone who you trust, to help guide you to the right sources to make that decision,‚Äù she said. With that in mind, several students from across North America launched a peer-to-peer education program called Students for Herd Immunity to allow kids to have those conversations among themselves. The public health experts agree, the debate around vaccines has become polarized and open conversations will be the key to addressing parents' concerns. ‚ÄúI think one thing to say to parents is you don't have to make your decision right away,‚Äù Dubey said. ‚ÄúI mean for those who are ready to make their decision, but it's fine but if you have questions, seek the answers.‚Äù Her only advice is to get those answers from a trusted source, and not social media.

China to start vaccinating children to age 3 as cases spread,https://www.nsnews.com/coronavirus-covid-19-national-news/china-to-start-vaccinating-children-to-age-3-as-cases-spread-4546629,,['Canadian Press'],,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) ‚Äî Children as young as 3 will start receiving COVID-19 vaccines in China, where 76% of the population has been fully vaccinated and authorities are maintaining a zero-tolerance policy toward outbreaks.",,10/25/21 14:35,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) ‚Äî Children as young as 3 will start receiving COVID-19 vaccines in China, where 76% of the population has been fully vaccinated and authorities are maintaining a zero-tolerance policy toward outbreaks. China becomes one of the very few countries in the world to start vaccinating children that young against the virus. Cuba, for one, has begun a vaccine drive for children as young as 2. The U.S. and many European countries allow COVID-19 shots down to age 12, though the U.S. is moving quickly toward opening vaccinations to 5- to 11-year-olds. Local city and provincial level governments in at least five Chinese provinces issued notices in recent days announcing that children ages 3 to 11 will be required to get their vaccinations. The expansion of the vaccination campaign comes as parts of China take new clampdown measures to try to stamp out small outbreaks. Gansu, a northwestern province heavily dependent on tourism, closed all tourist sites Monday after finding new COVID-19 cases. Residents in parts of Inner Mongolia have been ordered to stay indoors because of an outbreak there. The National Health Commission reported that 35 new cases of local transmission had been detected over the past 24 hours, four of them in Gansu. An additional 19 cases were found in the Inner Mongolia region, with others scattered around the country. China has employed lockdowns, quarantines and compulsory testing for the virus throughout the pandemic and has largely stamped out cases of local infection while fully vaccinating 1.07 billion people out of a population of 1.4 billion. In particular, the government is concerned about the spread of the more contagious delta variant by travelers and about having a largely vaccinated public ahead of the Beijing Olympics in February. Overseas spectators already have been banned from the Winter Games, and participants will have to stay in a bubble separating them from people outside. China's most widely used vaccines, from Sinopharm and Sinovac, have shown efficacy in preventing severe disease and transmission of the virus, based on public data. But the protection they offer against the delta variant has not been answered definitively, although officials say they remain protective. Hubei, Fujian and Hainan provinces all issued provincial level notices alerting new vaccination requirements, while individual cities in Zhejiang province and Hunan province have also issued similar announcements. China in June had approved two vaccines ‚Äî Sinopharm's from the Beijing Institute of Biological Products and Sinovac ‚Äî for children ages 3 to 17, but it has only been vaccinating those 12 and older. In August, regulators approved another, Sinopharm's from the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products. After the vaccines received domestic approval for children in China, foreign governments began giving the shots to children in their own countries. Cambodia uses both Sinovac and Sinopharm‚Äôs shots in children 6 to 11. Regulators in Chile approved Sinovac for children as young as 6. In Argentina, regulators approved the Sinopharm vaccine for children as young as age 3. Many developing countries left out of the race to get shots from Western pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna bought Chinese vaccines. China has shipped more than 1.2 billion doses as of September, according to its Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Even with widespread domestic and global use, not every parent is reassured about the vaccine, citing less publicly available data on the shots. Wang Lu, who lives in the southern city of Fuzhou in Fujian province, said she isn‚Äôt particularly rushing to get her 3-year-old son vaccinated. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just not very clear on the vaccine‚Äôs safety profile, so I don‚Äôt really want to get him vaccinated, at the very least, I don‚Äôt want to be the first,‚Äù Wang said. Sinovac started an efficacy trial with 14,000 child participants across multiple countries in September. Its approval in China was based on smaller phase 1 and phase 2 trials. Sinopharm‚Äôs Beijing shot was also approved based on smaller phase 1 and phase 2 trials. These were published later in peer-reviewed journals. Other parents said they weren‚Äôt concerned, given that many other people had already gotten the shot. Wu Cong, a mom of a 7-year old, said her daughter‚Äôs school in Shanghai hadn‚Äôt yet notified them of any vaccinations. ‚ÄúI think this isn‚Äôt too different from the flu vaccine, there‚Äôs already been so many people vaccinated, so I don‚Äôt have too many worries,‚Äù said Wu. ___ Associated Press researcher Chen Si in Shanghai contributed to this report.

Provincewide, officials are reporting 326 new cases of COVID-19, and no new deaths. The province added 26 new cases to its total for Ottawa on Monday. Figures from OPH often differ from Public Health Ontario's because the two health agencies pull data for their respective daily snapshot reports at different times of the day.

Win McNamee/Getty Images hide caption A nurse draw a Moderna COVID-19 vaccine dose from a vial at the Cameron Grove Community Center in Bowie, Md., in late March. Moderna says study data supports use of a half-dose of the vaccine in children 6 to 11. Moderna says a study in kids 6 to 11 found two doses of the company's COVID-19 vaccine given 28 days apart produced a strong antibody response. The study, conducted in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health, used shots containing a 50 microgram dose of the vaccine, half the dose of the Moderna shots authorized for adults. More than 4,700 children ages 5 to 11 took part in the study. The most common side effects were fatigue, headache, fever and pain at the site of injection. The company says the analysis showed a ""favorable safety profile."" The summary of the study results was made available in a press release . The information hasn't been peer reviewed or published, but Moderna said it plans to submit them to a scientific journal for publication. The company also said it plans to submit the data to regulators, a move that would support the authorization of the vaccine for kids 6 to 11. The release of the data comes a day before a panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration will review use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children 5 to 11 years of age. In June, Moderna submitted study results involving nearly 2,500 adolescents ages 12 to 15 to the FDA. The agency hasn't yet issued a decision on whether to expand use of the Moderna vaccine to that age group. In May, the FDA expanded authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to include adolescents 12 to 15 years of age.",,npr

The 84-year-old Powell died of complications related to COVID, despite being double vaccinated. That is fact. But opportunists used that fact to promote their anti-vax stance, while failing to mention Powell had been treated for prostate cancer, and had suffered from multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that weakens your immune system. Powell, even while vaccinated, was about as vulnerable as they come to infection. Matt O' Donnell talks about vaccine efficacy, comorbidities and risk factors plus the lies by omission of fact and misinformation that spread immediately after the news of Powell's death went public. Guests: Dr. Paul Offit, Director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and one of the world's foremost experts on vaccines.

They include three Nasa astronauts: Raja Chari, mission commander; Tom Marshburn, pilot; and Kayla Barron, mission specialist. In addition, ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer will serve as a mission specialist on the mission. Launch time and how to watch The launch window opens at 2:21am EST (7:21am BST) on Sunday, October 31. The crew will liftoff on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at NASA‚Äôs Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The Crew Dragon Endurance is scheduled to dock to the space station at 12:10am EST (5:10am BST) Monday, November 1. Prelaunch activities, launch, and docking will air live on NASA Television, the NASA app, and the agency‚Äôs website. What is SpaceX? Here's what you need to know... SpaceX is a cash-flushed rocket company that wants to take man to Mars. It was set up by eccentric billionaire Elon Musk in 2002 and is based in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX‚Äôs first aim was to build rockets that can autonomously land back on Earth for refurbishment and re-use. The technology makes launching and operating space flights more efficient, and therefore cheaper. SpaceX currently uses its reusable Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets to fly cargo to the International Space Station (ISS) for Nasa. It also carries satellites and other space tech into orbit for various government agencies and multinational companies. The company took astronauts to the ISS for the first time in 2020. Other future missions involve carrying tourists to the ISS and astronauts to the Moon and Mars. Musk has repeatedly said he believes humanity must colonise Mars to save itself from extinction. He plans to get a SpaceX rocket to the Red Planet by 2027.

Kennedy, Jr., Chairman of Children‚Äôs Health Defense (CHD), and Meryl Nass, MD have sent a letter to each member of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) highlighting the latest peer reviewed research that shows children have virtually zero risk of hospitalization and death from the COVID-19 virus. ‚ÄúConversely, according to Pfizer‚Äôs own study trial data , the chance of death in children from the Pfizer vaccine is 107 times higher than death due to COVID,‚Äù said Dr. Brian Hooker, CHD Chief Science Officer. VRBPAC meets tomorrow, October 26, to decide whether or not to approve Pfizer‚Äôs experimental COVID vaccine for children ages five to eleven. Here are the VRBPAC committee members: Hana El Sahly, MD ; Paula Annunziato, MD ; Archana Chatterjee, MD; CAPT Amanda Cohn, MD ; Hayley Gans, MD ; Holly Janes, PhD ; Michael Kurilla, MD ; Myron Levine, MD ; H. Cody Meissner, MD ; Paul Offit; Steven Pergam, M D; Andrea Shane, MD ; Paul Spearman, MD ; Geeta K. Swamy, MD ; Gregg Sylvester, MD ; A. Oveta Fuller, PhD ; James Hildreth, Sr., Ph., MD ; Jeannette Lee, PhD ; Ofer Levy, MD ; Patrick Moore, MD ; Michael Nelson, M.D ; Stanley Perlman, MD ; Jay Portnoy, MD ; and Eric Rubin, MD . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is scheduled to meet November 2 and 3 to consider and vote upon the same experimental vaccine. If both committees approve the vaccine for this age group, the decision is then reviewed by CDC Director Rochelle Walensky to formalize the recommendation. ‚ÄúParents should be aware that if these committees give Big Pharma an early holiday present, the vaccines will still only have emergency use authorization (EUA),‚Äù said CHD president and general counsel Mary Holland. ‚ÄúThis means the shots are experimental and legally cannot be mandated under U.S. law. Parents can say no.‚Äù School administrators can also decline to incorporate any requirements regarding COVID vaccine status for attending school. ‚ÄúThese administrators should not be in the uncomfortable position of being the vaccine police for the pharmaceutical industry,‚Äù commented Holland. ‚ÄúThe choice for parents and school officials is simple. They should never allow the government to force a medical procedure on children especially when they have a minuscule risk of hospitalization and death from COVID.‚Äù Children have very low transmission rates of the virus as well. Additionally, the vaccine‚Äôs experimental mRNA technology has no long-term safety studies upon which parents can make informed decisions after weighing risks and benefits. And, if adult vaccines are any indication, the vaccine will start to wane in children in two to three months according to two recent studies . From mid-December, 2020 through October 15, 2021, the U.S. government‚Äôs database, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) received 818,044 reports of injury following COVID vaccination including 17,128 deaths . ""These numbers are astounding,‚Äù said CHD Executive Director Laura Bono. ‚ÄúHalf of all reports and two thirds of all deaths reported to the VAERS system in the U.S. since the tracking system was developed in 1990 relate to the COVID 19 vaccines. No physician with an ounce of integrity could possibly vote to approve such a risky vaccine to people of any age, let alone healthy five-year-olds who are at virtually zero risk for complications from COVID."" On October 20, well in advance of the FDA and CDC meetings, the Biden administration said it had procured enough vaccine to vaccinate all 28 million 5- to 11-year-olds in the U.S. To CHD‚Äôs knowledge, the Biden Administration has not released the dollar amount of taxpayer funds that was transferred to Pfizer for children‚Äôs shots but, even at the highly unlikely low cost of $1 a dose, it translates into $65 million dollars handed to Big Pharma before the vaccine was even FDA authorized and CDC recommended. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no surprise that the federal government and Pharma already know how these votes will go,‚Äù said Holland. ‚ÄúThese meetings are nothing more than empty rituals in support of lining Pharma‚Äôs pockets. Parents need to know that the fix is in and an approval from either of these committees means nothing in terms of the safety of the vaccines Pharma wants injected into their children.‚Äù The letter from Kennedy and CHD said that committee members ‚Äúshould not participate in an exercise disguising a foregone conclusion‚Äù and that ‚Äúshould you grant EUA status to this pediatric EUA vaccine, CHD is poised to take legal action against you and other VRBPAC voting members as well as the FDA. CHD will seek to hold you accountable for recklessly endangering this population with a product that has little efficacy but which may put them, without warning, at risk of many adverse health consequences...‚Äù According to recent data from Indiana University‚Äôs Observatory on Social Media, CHD‚Äôs website is shared on Twitter more often than those of the World Health Organization and CDC combined. This indicates that a growing number of Americans and citizens of the world are saying no to their government imposing health mandates, recommendations and other personal choices on them and their children that is clearly in violation of their individual rights. The same data also showed that CHD‚Äôs content, which recently reached nearly 10 million page views per month, is more widely shared than that from Reuters , The Daily Mail , The Washington Post , Newsweek and CNN. Dr. Meryl Nass will be conducting a live blog during the proceedings of both the VRBAC and ACIP meetings to interpret and comment on the presentations and votes from CHD-TV . Viewers can also submit questions to Dr. Nass in real time. To watch and participate in Dr. Nass‚Äôs live blog of both committee meetings, visit CHD.T V. Concerned members of the public can add a comment to the FDA VRBPAC Committee by Monday at midnight. ### Children's Health Defense is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Its mission is to end childhood health epidemics by working aggressively to eliminate harmful exposures, hold those responsible accountable, and establish safeguards to prevent future harm.

Seniors in B.C. staying sharp and connected through unique learning program ‚ÄòTALK‚Äô,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2021/10/25/talk-bc-seniors-learning/,,['clairefenton'],,The volunteer-run Third Age Learning at Kwantlen (TALK) offers lectures on a variety of topics to connect seniors in B.C.,"For some B.C. seniors a chance to head back to class through a unique and affordable program has been their saving grace during the pandemic. The volunteer-run Third Age Learning at Kwantlen (TALK) is an accessible way to find out about the world, and offers lectures on a variety of topics, including history, art, science, technology, and current events. There are no tests, and the lectures are open to discussion and conversations, making the program a time for people 50 and over to interact and share ideas. ‚ÄúYou want to keep your brain active, you want to keep your social connections active, you want to learn new things. As a volunteer you want to contribute to your community, you want to learn new technical skills. TALK gives you all of those things,‚Äù program chair and longtime volunteer Jean Garnett said. She jokes that talk is cheap, because being a member of TALK is only $10 a year, which allows seniors on a limited budget a chance to still learn new things. TALK Third Age Learning at Kwantlen/Facebook Gillian Roberts has been a passionate TALK supporter for years. She says the classes remind her of her university life. She says she understands people might be intimidated to attend their first class, like she did. But once she went, she felt totally at home. ‚ÄúPeople are very welcoming. They love to see new people show up. They are an interesting and interested bunch. Just come, it‚Äôs really worth it,‚Äù Roberts said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really open to anybody, as long as you‚Äôre old!‚Äù Roberts added, Seniors do a pandemic pivot TALK has been around for 20 years, but when the pandemic put the world on hold, the volunteers were tasked with finding a new way to keep the program running. They switched to online classes, and despite misconceptions around seniors and technology, the program actually saw a 50 per cent jump in registrations. Now, the online classes are so popular that despite the resumption of in-person learning, many classes will stay virtual, with the other third back at their familiar Kwantlen campuses. Roberts says the program has been able to get help from technology wizards at Gluu, which works with seniors‚Äô organizations on skills like virtual learning, to help those who didn‚Äôt know how to get online. Related Articles: Family visits through robots? Researchers test new tech in B.C. long-term care Virtual visits during COVID-19 may have led to more loneliness among older people ‚ÄúThe zoom webinar format allows us to be a little more outreaching in terms of our membership and in terms of our members, which is great,‚Äù Garnett said, adding members are able to join in from around the world. With travel restrictions in place, it also allows seniors a chance to escape. ‚ÄúWe have one particular member who took 36 TALK courses last year and she says that because she wasn‚Äôt allowed to travel with her husband, she was going to travel in her mind and learn new things that way,‚Äù Garnett said. TALK is not the same as auditing a course. Through TALK only people in the 50+ age bracket are allowed to attend the lectures, helping many people feel comfortable asking questions and taking part. ‚ÄúAs an older person you can go to university and you can audit courses, they are usually longer, you are in a class with younger people which is fun but there‚Äôs nothing like being with your peers,‚Äù Roberts said.

[+] Infectious Diseases, arrives to testify before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on July 20, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Stefani Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images) Getty Images The Biden Administration has lost much credibility in the eyes of the American people at the very point when credibility is desperately needed. Unfortunately, Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the most influential spokespersons for the Administration, is among the list of those whose credibility has suffered. And that loss is damaging to public health. Talented, accomplished, credentialed and good-willed though he may be, even ""America's Doctor"" needs to rebuild credibility and establish trust. One of the latest blows to his credibility and reputation came in early October, when he told a Face the Nation interviewer that ‚Äúit is just too soon to tell"" if families and groups were going to be able to gather together to celebrate Christmas. The backlash to his comment was swift and strong. He later claimed his words were taken out of context , but the damage was already done. Public trust in the government with regard to Covid-19 was eroded by yet one more degree. Despite what Dr. Fauci has accomplished in his post over the past 21 months, amid some extraordinarily challenging circumstances, inconsistent statements not supported by science undermine even his ability to influence the behavior of the American people. This recent head-scratching claim ‚Äî that our chances for Christmas are still up in the air ‚Äî not only contravened the government's own data, but also made little sense in light of the American public's current habits. At the beginning of October, the CDC reported that Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations were down 15% from the previous week. But more importantly, Americans are packing by the millions into sports stadiums, airports and public transportation every week. They are returning ‚Äî have returned ‚Äî to normal life. For these people, regardless of their immunity status, comments like Fauci's are irrelevant at best, and fodder for divisive rhetoric at worst. Credibility is needed to build trust, and trust, in turn, is essential to having the right to influence others. The nation needs credible voices who have earned trust in order to influence healthy choices. Credibility relies on several foundational pillars. Dr. Fauci still has the support of his position, title and authority in government. But the additional pillars of credibility he once had, derived from a reputation of making judgments on the basis of science alone and from consistency in messaging, have crumbled.

The American people largely concluded that his early flip-flop on the necessity of masks was not entirely based on scientific merit. Nor were some of his moving-target statements about herd immunity thresholds. More recently, critical legislators have hammered him for his insistence that migrants at the southern border were not to blame for the spread of the virus, while he at the same time adamantly supported a vaccine mandate for all other international travelers. The Administration has universally mandated vaccines ‚Äî largely without exception ‚Äî for government workers and for those using public transportation. The failure to allow for exceptions under unique circumstances, despite individuals being willing to undergo testing to show they are disease free, comes off as dogmatic and doctrinaire ‚Äî essentially not following the scientific data but putting in place rules ‚Äî often inconsistently ‚Äî that just don‚Äôt make sense. Politics are at work here, but give the politicians credit: they're good at smoking out inconsistencies in their opponents. Ultimately, this credibility issue is a threat to public health both now and in the future. Covid-19 numbers may be falling these days but, in many respects, the coronavirus is still a generational threat to public health which demands the best efforts of government and private citizens alike to keep at bay. As we move away from letting the virus manage us to instead manage our own lives, we need trustworthy public health voices to guide our transition. If the Biden administration wants to be that voice, it needs all its choir members to be singing from the same songbook. It would be self-defeating to have one member continue to proverbially shoot himself in the foot. And while we're at it, they might pump the brakes on broad brush generalizations and blanket global mandates, which by their inflexibility disagree with science in many cases, further eroding credibility. Perhaps more importantly, we'll need trustworthy public health voices to guide us through crises still to come. Viruses will do what viruses do ‚Äî mutate and pose novel threats to public health. The credibility of experts like Dr. Fauci will be critical to our ability to take protective measures in the future, should they become necessary. Recall the ""boy who cried wolf"" ‚Äî every misstep Dr. Fauci and his colleagues make now could hinder our ability to respond to the next public health challenge coming down the road. Building trust depends on our leaders being honest, direct and straightforward. From the perspective of human behavior, we know that when people don‚Äôt trust the messenger, they're prone to stop listening, disregarding facts and often doing the exact opposite of what good judgment would dictate. Last year, I wrote about the importance of fact-based communications during the pandemic. Even with a long and commendable record of public service, Dr. Fauci has reached a point where many no longer perceive him as a credible source for facts that could inform behavior, especially to the people he needs to sway the most. This gap of public trust is doing harm. It is time for him to turn his attention to the hard work of rebuilding credibility and restoring the trust of the American people.",https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/0x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/6165f90b5a52824eb2dc6493/0x0.jpg,forbes

SMDC rebuilds real estate growth and momentum,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/10/26/business/real-estate-and-property/smdc-rebuilds-real-estate-growth-and-momentum/1819731,['Business'],['Aaron Ronquillo'],,"SM Development Corp. (SMDC) has been building momentum in its drive to invest in projects that meet the needs of the country's population.According to SMDC President, Jose Mari Banzon, the industry will endure despite the pandemic for as long as the essential elements fueling the industry's growth are there ‚Äì shortage in housing, young and educated workforce, and overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who have been bringing money back through their remittances amounting to $30 billion. With 70 percent of the workforce comprising the youth, the property giant continues to distinguish itself as an appealing investment for a market composed mostly of OFWs and young future homeowners looking for a place of their own to grow.""SMDC developed residential features designed to meet the multi-faceted needs of young Filipinos,"" Banzon explained.""The residential designs of our developments include powerful connectivity, shared working spaces, accommodating towards ride-sharing services and many features geared towards wellness, safety, and security ‚Äì hallmark features of any modern living space,"" he added.Strategic locations While the pandemic halted the projects of other developers, SMDC was not deterred and it was able to restart its rebuilding and development projects. It has launched projects in central business districts of Metro Manila, and in growth centers in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.With accessibility and sustainability in mind, SMDC continues to build on key locations that provide affordable yet luxurious living. As one of the country's fastest growing developers, locations near retail environments, business districts, transport hubs, medical facilities, government services, essential goods and services are important for its strategic value. It is very beneficial benefits for residents have these essential places near their homes for easy access.Ongoing infrastructure projects involving mass transport systems and road networks are expected to contribute to the continued growth of the industry.Commitment to ESG On top of plans to reaching a wider market, SMDC's commitment to ESG (environmental, social and governance) continues to be a driving force as part of their contribution to nation-building by providing housing that can be affordable by many Filipinos.All developments launched by SMDC comply with standards in terms of resilience and minimizing environmental impact. SMDC projects are guaranteed to be disaster-ready, energy-efficient, PWD (persons with disability)-friendly and incorporate open spaces abundant of greenery, natural lighting, ventilation and waste management systems.SMDC ensures that they create communities that are secure, inclusive, and positively impact their quality of life.Doing its part in promoting spaces safe from Covid-19, SMDC has conducted Covid-19 vaccination drives in partnership with LGUs and the Philippine Red Cross in all their developments. Currently, SMDC was able to administer 4,000 residents and employees with a goal to vaccinate 10,000 people by the end of the year.Other Covid-19 response efforts include a health and wellness caravan, held in partnership with the SM Foundation, the Philippine Red Cross, and the Department of Health, which allowed residents to get screened for a variety of medical conditions besides Covid-19.The Good Guys weekend market made it easy for SMDC residents to conveniently buy fresh produce straight from the growers themselves. As seen in these initiatives, empowerment is a consistent thrust for SMDC, not only for the communities they have built, but also for those who live around them as well.The pandemic has impacted many livelihoods.

Tech firms are usually more susceptible to higher borrowing costs.News that troubled China Evergrande had paid interest due on a bond before Saturday's deadline provided a much-needed boost to confidence though it remains to be seen whether it can meet obligations on other notes due before the end of the year.Hong Kong and Shanghai fluctuated through the early session, with traders keeping tabs on the latest Delta variant outbreak in mainland China, which comes just over three months before the country hosts the Winter Olympics.The latest spike has forced authorities to reimpose strict containment measures, but there are fears of a wider lockdown which would weigh on economic growth. Recent outbreaks this year played a role in the below-par expansion seen in the third quarter.There were gains in Sydney, Seoul and Jakarta but Tokyo, Singapore, Taipei and Manila fell.Traders are preparing for the Federal Reserve to join several other central banks around the world in winding down the massive financial support put in place at the outset of the pandemic.Boss Jerome Powell said last week that the bank's vast bond-buying should now be tapered, with expectations he will begin the pullback as early as next month, though he was not ready to hike borrowing costs yet.""The risks are clearly now to longer and more persistent bottlenecks, and thus to higher inflation,"" he said Friday.""I would say our policy is well-positioned to manage a range of plausible outcomes,"" he said. ""I do think it's time to taper and I don't think it's time to raise rates.""Oil prices pressed higher, with Brent at a three-year high above $86, while WTI was within sight of $85 for the first time since October 2014.The latest rise comes after Saudi Arabia said OPEC and other major producers would be cautious in lifting output despite surging demand, warning that the pandemic still posed a threat to the outlook.The Turkish lira tumbled more than one percent against the dollar after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for the expulsion of ambassadors from 10 countries, including Germany and the United States, who had appealed for the release of a jailed civil society leader.",,10/25/21 16:11,,,manilatimes

What a pediatrician says about the COVID vaccine for kids,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-kids-pediatrician-questions-answers/,,,,"Former acting CDC Director Dr. Richard Besser, pediatrician and President of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, weighs in on new guidelines for 5-11 year olds.",,10/25/21 16:16,"Children aged 5 to 11 will soon be able to get a COVID-19 vaccine at their pediatrician's office, local pharmacy and potentially even their school, the White House announced on Wednesday as it detailed plans for the expected authorization of the Pfizer shot for younger children in a matter of weeks. Federal regulators will meet over the next two weeks to weigh the benefits of giving shots to kids, after lengthy studies meant to ensure the safety of the vaccines. So what does this mean for families and the fight against COVID-19 ? Here's what Dr. Richard Besser, former acting CDC director and president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, told ""Face the Nation."" The White House has announced plans to distribute vaccines for 5-11 year olds. As a pediatrician, how soon can parents expect to have their kids vaccinated? If the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes the use of this vaccine in children and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends it, vaccines could be available by early November. As both a pediatrician and a parent, I'm looking forward to having a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine for young children. While we can all be grateful that they are at less risk of severe disease, the impact of the pandemic on children has been profound. ‚Ä¢ More than 6 million children in the U.S. have gotten COVID-19, including more than 1.1 million in the last six weeks alone. ‚Ä¢ More than 600 children have died from COVID-19, 158 of whom have been between the ages of 5 and 11. ‚Ä¢ More than 5,000 children have gotten a severe multisystem inflammatory condition known as MIS-C following a COVID-19 diagnosis, which can have debilitating physical effects. Children who haven't gotten COVID-19 directly have still been hit hard by this virus. More than 140,000 children have lost a parent or caregiver, while long-term school closures and lockdowns have negatively affected children's social, emotional, and mental health. Across the board, children of color and those from low-income families have suffered disproportionately from COVID-19. Fortunately, we're moving closer to a vaccine for younger children. Here's how it works: On October 26th, the FDA's independent advisory committee on vaccines, known as VRBPAC, will meet to decide whether to recommend a vaccine for kids in this age group. If the FDA ultimately authorizes that vaccine, the CDC's independent advisory committee, known as ACIP, is scheduled to meet on November 2nd and 3rd to make recommendations on who should get it; the CDC director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, would then need to announce her official recommendations before any vaccines for children are administered. If that timeline holds, and both the FDA and CDC give the green light, we would probably see the first shots going in kids' arms within days of the CDC's official recommendation being announced. It is critically important from both a health and trust standpoint that we allow this process to play out rather than simply assuming the vaccine will be authorized. The FDA, the CDC, and their respective independent agencies must undertake a thorough and independent review to determine whether the vaccine is safe and effective for children in this age group. The data that have been released to date are promising, but independent scientific review must guide this process. The Biden administration is planning to push vaccines out through many channels including doctors offices, local pharmacies, and schools. They aren't planning on doing mass vaccination clinics like we saw for adults. Will this do enough to ensure vaccines go to the most vulnerable or needy of school aged children? I'm excited about the approach that is being taken. The Biden administration has announced that it has purchased enough vaccines for the 28 million children in the U.S. who are in the 5-11 age group. They are working with states and localities to plan for vaccines to be distributed to all communities. It makes a lot of sense to provide shots in settings where children are used to being vaccinated, such as their doctor's offices where trust levels are high. As a pediatrician, I am used to vaccinating children and answering questions from caregivers every single time I'm in the clinic. But we also know that many children do not have health insurance or their own healthcare provider: the latest figures show that 5.6% of children were uninsured in 2020, but the uninsured rate is nearly twice as high for children in poverty. That's why vaccination clinics at other places, such as hospitals, pharmacies, health centers, and schools, are all essential to reach children in all neighborhoods. Moreover, it is critical that public health officials collect data on race, ethnicity, and neighborhood so that any disparities in vaccine uptake can be documented and addressed. We also need to make it as easy as possible for parents to get their children vaccinated and stay home with them if side effects keep some kids out of school for a day. Unfortunately, in the United States, people's access to paid leave benefits largely depends on their job and income level. We are the only wealthy nation that does not guarantee any paid leave for new parents or to care for a sick family member. Black, Latino and Indigenous people are much more likely to work in minimum wage jobs that don't provide paid leave. Emergency legislation passed by Congress has incentivized more employers to offer paid leave benefits, including time off for vaccination, but temporary tax credits for that purpose have expired and approximately 100 million workers remain without any paid leave at all. The idea that any parent would have to choose between earning a paycheck and getting their children a potentially life-saving vaccine is just wrong. It is well past time for the United States to establish a national paid leave program that covers all workers while taking meaningful steps to ensure working families have quality and affordable child care options. What would you tell parents who are still unsure about the COVID-19 vaccine? It is understandable that parents would have questions and concerns about any new vaccine. Polling shows that parents are split on COVID-19 vaccines for children: some plan to get their children vaccinated right away; some have no intention of doing so at all; and some prefer to take a ""wait and see"" approach. We have seen these divergent viewpoints play out with vaccines for both adults and adolescents, so it is not a surprise to see it with younger children as well, especially since the clinical trials for children at this age level were far smaller than those conducted for adults. As a pediatrician, I've spent many hours counseling parents on vaccines for children. Just a few days ago, in the clinic where I still see patients, I talked with a mother about vaccines for her teenage sons. She wants to see more data before she makes her decision. We had an open and respectful conversation. In my experience, pressuring and berating people doesn't work. The first step is to listen; it's important that we give people the time and space to ask questions and have their concerns heard. Parents should bring those questions or concerns to a healthcare provider or others they trust to get accurate information. Vaccine misinformation is rampant and its continued spread ultimately disrespects and endangers those who may have legitimate questions for which they're seeking honest answers. The approach that is being planned for administering COVID-19 vaccines to younger children will make it easier for these conversations to happen. While kids are at a lower risk of COVID complications, how should parents of young children, infants and up to 5 years old, approach the virus? While it is cause for optimism that caseloads have dropped significantly in recent weeks, they remain extremely high, and the U.S. is still averaging approximately 1,500 deaths per day. I don't believe we will truly get a handle on this pandemic unless and until safe and effective vaccines are available for all age groups and until more adults decide to get vaccinated. It's important to remember that even if vaccines are authorized for children ages 5-11, children under age 5 still won't be vaccine-eligible, and they are likely to remain ineligible until early 2022 at the earliest. One of those most important steps we can take to protect children ineligible for vaccination is to ensure that the adults around them are fully vaccinated. There are currently about 66 million vaccine-eligible people in the United States who remain unvaccinated. In places where vaccination rates are particularly low, those communities remain especially susceptible to additional cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Achieving a higher vaccination rate across the board is the most important step we can take to save lives. There are other steps we can take to keep our youngest children safe. The CDC recommends that everyone age 2 and up in schools and child care facilities wear masks. That's an essential component of keeping kids, teachers, and staff safe, and increasing the chances that these facilities will be able to operate safely and stay open. The CDC also recommends that everybody ages six months and up gets a flu shot. That is incredibly important. In a typical flu season, thousands of young children are hospitalized from the flu, and we're already starting to see some respiratory viruses circulate earlier than usual this year with kids back in schools and child care facilities. Flu shots save lives and ease the strain on hospitals and other healthcare providers. Do you envision a future of a COVID vaccine or booster being part of routine childhood immunizations like the polio vaccine any time soon? Vaccines have been a part of my professional career for decades. There is nothing I do as a pediatrician that has more proven health value than working to ensure that all of my patients are fully vaccinated on time. Every state requires vaccinations for children to attend school. Vaccination rates for required immunizations, such as measles, mumps, and rubella, tend to be extremely high. We have seen a growing number of vaccine mandates in workplace settings across the country, which I think is the right move. We're even seeing this among younger populations; some schools already require COVID-19 vaccines for certain older children, such as high school student-athletes. While all three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. are extremely effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and deaths, only Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine has been granted full approval by the FDA to date, and only for those ages 16 and up. Over time, as the evidence base around vaccine efficacy and safety continues to build, we may see more full approvals granted by the FDA, and for younger age groups. Additional full approvals may well lead COVID-19 vaccines to eventually being recommended as part of the CDC's routine childhood immunization schedule, and would likely lead to greater numbers of states and localities adopting COVID-19 vaccine requirements.

Pfizer's kid-size vaccine doses are closer to widespread use. They are undergoing evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration for youngsters in nearly the same age group, 5 to 11, and could be available by early November.

Preliminary results showed vaccinated children developed virus-fighting antibodies similar to levels that young adults produce after full-strength shots, Moderna said in a news release. The study involved 4,753 children ages 6 to 11 who got either the vaccine or dummy shots. Moderna said that like adults, the vaccinated youngsters had temporary side effects, including fatigue, headache, fever and injection site pain. The study was too small to spot any extremely rare side effects, such as heart inflammation that sometimes occurs after either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, mostly among young men.

Moderna says its low-dose COVID vaccine works for kids 6 to 11,https://abc30.com/moderna-vaccine-for-kids-who-has-near-me-costco-booster-covid/11166164/,,['AP'],,"Moderna said half-dose shots induced strong levels of virus-fighting antibodies in youngsters, with temporary side effects such as fever and fatigue.",,10/25/21 16:31,"Moderna said Monday that a low dose of its COVID-19 vaccine is safe and appears to work in 6- to 11-year-olds, as the manufacturer moves toward expanding shots to children. Competitor Pfizer's kid-sized vaccine doses are closer to widespread use, undergoing evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration for nearly the same age group - starting at age 5. Its vaccine already is authorized for anyone 12 or older. Moderna hasn't yet gotten the nod to offer its vaccine to teens but is studying lower doses in younger children while it waits. Researchers tested two shots for the 6- to 11-year-olds, given a month apart, that each contained half the dose given to adults. Preliminary results showed vaccinated kids developed virus-fighting antibodies similar to levels that young adults produce after full-strength shots, Moderna said in a press release. The study included 4,753 kids ages 6 to 11, who got either the vaccine or dummy shots. Moderna said that like adults, the vaccinated youngsters had temporary side effects including fatigue, headache, fever and injection site pain. The study was too small to spot any extremely rare side effects, such as heart inflammation that sometimes occurs after either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, mostly among young men. Moderna said it plans to submit its pediatric data to the FDA and global regulators soon. The FDA hasn't yet ruled on the company's application to expand its vaccinations to 12- to 17-year-olds, although some countries have cleared Moderna's shots for adolescents. But the U.S. is expected to begin vaccinating kids under 12 sometime next month, if the FDA clears small doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds. Pfizer reported last week that its kid-sized doses proved nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in the younger age group, even as the extra-contagious delta variant was spreading widely. FDA's advisers will deliberate Pfizer's evidence in a public meeting Tuesday. If the agency authorizes Pfizer's kid shots, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the following week is set to recommend who should receive them.",,abc30

CO2 is the most important, accounting for around 66 percent of the warming effect on the climate. CO2 concentrations reached 413.2 parts per million (ppm) in 2020, up 2.5 ppm and is at 149 percent of the 1,750 pre-industrial levels, the WMO said.The report said that roughly half of the CO2 emitted by human activity remains in the atmosphere, with the other half ending up in the oceans and the land.""The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3 to 5 million years ago when the temperature was 2 to 3 C warmer and sea level was 10 to 20 meters higher than now. But there weren't 7.8 billion people then,"" said Taalas.Methane averages reached a new high of 1,889 parts per billion (ppb) in 2020, up 11 ppb on the year before and is at 262 percent of the pre-industrial benchmark.Around 40 percent of methane is emitted from natural sources, such as wetlands, while 60 percent comes from human activity including rice agriculture and landfills.Nitrous oxide averages reached 333.2 ppb, up 1.2 ppb, at 123 percent of 1,750 levels.The WMO said that with continued rising greenhouse gas emissions, alongside rising temperatures, the planet could also expect more weather extremes.That includes intense heat and rainfall, ice melt, sea-level rise and ocean acidification ‚Äî all of which will have far-reaching socioeconomic impacts.""We need to transform our commitment into action that will have an impact on the gases that drive climate change,"" said Taalas.""We need to revisit our industrial, energy and transport systems and whole way of life. The needed changes are economically affordable and technically possible. There is no time to lose."" Euan Nisbet, from the University of London's Greenhouse Gas Group, compared greenhouse gas measurements to ""skidding into a car crash.""""The disaster gets closer and closer but you can't stop it. You can clearly see the crash ahead and all you can do is howl."" Dave Reay, director of the Edinburgh Climate Change Institute, said the report provided a ""brutally frank"" assessment of COP achievements so far: ""an epic fail.""",,10/25/21 16:42,,https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2021/10/26/22593.jpg,manilatimes

Moderna released no further details and hasn't submitted its data to a scientific journal but said it plans to share the interim results with the FDA and global regulators soon. The study is still going on, and the company cannot calculate the vaccine's effectiveness in actually preventing infections in children unless there are sufficient COVID-19 cases to compare rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants.

Climate council unveils recommended carbon budgets up to 2030,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/climate-council-unveils-recommended-carbon-budgets-up-to-2030-1.4710187?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"The Climate Change Advisory Council has finalised its recommendations for two, five-year carbon budgets aimed at reducing the State‚Äôs carbon emissions by 51 per cent by 2030. The average year-on-year reductions in the first ‚Äúbudget‚Äù to 2025 has been set at just under 4.8 per cent, while the average year-on-year reductions in the second budget to 2030 is set at 8.3 per cent. The advisory council, which includes leading climate scientists and energy experts, accepts the most significant reductions will be towards the end of the decade ‚Äì as key investments will take time to kick in ‚Äì but it warns urgency is required in the meantime. The key figures are a limit on emissions for 2021-2025 of 295 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent and a 200 million tonnes CO2 limit for 2026-2030 relative to a 2018 baseline. The carbon budget for 2031-2035, which is provisional, is recommended at 151 million tonnes CO2. The ceilings set out the total amount of emissions allowed under two five-year carbon budgets. The Government must now set out how they will be applied to each sector, including the most challenging activities in transport, agriculture, heating, power generation and carbon-intensive industry. Once adopted by Cabinet and the Oireachtas, the Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan will use each carbon budget to prepare sectoral emissions ceilings for relevant sectors of the economy in consultation with other relevant Ministers. The Climate Action Bill, signed into law in July, put in place a legally binding commitment that the State must reduce carbon emissions by 51 per cent by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. On Monday, the council said ‚Äústrong, rapid and sustained reductions in emissions‚Äù in all sectors and all greenhouses gases were required to meet the climate challenge facing Ireland. Issuing its recommendations to the Government on emission ceilings that must apply up to 2030, it says: ‚ÄúThe proposed carbon budgets will require transformational changes for society and the economy which are necessary; failing to act on climate change would have grave consequences.‚Äù It is critically important that potential for adverse impacts is addressed, it continues. ‚ÄúIndividuals and communities at risk of loss of employment or disproportionate costs need to be identified and assisted in making the transition. The impact of these changes will require significant Government action with budgetary implications that need to be included in medium-term planning.‚Äù The advisory council highlights that social and economic impacts can be mitigated by appropriate policies and supportive infrastructures, ‚Äúwhile opportunities arising from a green reputation, and innovation in products and services to support the low carbon economy should be seized‚Äù. Ireland emitted 68.3 million tonnes of CO2 in 2018. Therefore, the first two carbon budgets must be consistent with emissions being cut to 33.5 million tonnes CO2 by 2030. ‚ÄúThis is a very significant challenge for our society and economy while we also grapple with other societal challenges such as the Covid pandemic, Brexit and housing,‚Äù the council pointed out in its report to the Government. The budgets are consistent with the Government‚Äôs commitment to halving greenhouse gases by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, council chair Marie Donnelly confirmed. ‚ÄúThe carbon budgets provide a framework, but what is urgently required is transformative change which is led by all of Government on a sustained basis, supported by all sectors of the economy, and all members of society. This will require significant investment across the economy,‚Äù she said. The budget is based on the best available science and defines ‚Äúan appropriate and necessary path‚Äù to addressing the climate challenge and for Ireland to comply with international commitments. ‚ÄúMany of the changes required will only have a real impact on emissions in the second period,‚Äù Ms Donnelly accepted. The council does not believe a 7 per cent per annum reduction ‚Äì set out in the programme for government ‚Äì in the first carbon budget is appropriate. However, the carbon budget programme for the decade ‚Äúrequires immediate action and investment in the first period . . . to deliver the accelerated reductions (in excess of 7 per cent annum) in the second carbon budget period required to meet the 2030 target of a 51 per cent reduction‚Äù. Methane The council endorses the need ‚Äúfor a strong, rapid and sustained reduction in methane emissions‚Äù as set out recently in a UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, but acknowledges this is challenging in agriculture. About 93 per cent of Irish methane emissions come from livestock-based agriculture, which are particularly hard to mitigate without changing output levels ‚Äì ie cattle numbers. New methane-based mitigation pathways (changing animal diet, additives and genetics) are being investigated in Ireland and internationally, which may deliver methane reductions in future, it finds. A critical issue in the Irish context is ‚Äúagricultural emissions are not offset by sequestration actions provided by the land use, land use change and forestry‚Äù. This means based on EPA scenarios, land use will still be an overall source of emissions in 2030. The CCAC outlines different combinations of reductions in dairy and suckler beef numbers could deliver emissions reductions but is not prescriptive. It cites Teagasc analysis which concludes only relatively small reductions in agricultural emissions can be achieved by ‚Äúcurrently proven technical mitigation alone‚Äù and under all scenarios analysed these alone are insufficient to leave agriculture within any of the core carbon budget scenarios considered. Larger reductions in agricultural emissions ‚Äúrequire both actions to achieve technical mitigation and actions to reduce livestock agricultural activity with reductions in beef and/or dairy activity contributing increasing shares of the reduction in agricultural GHG [greenhouse gases] across the progressively more ambitious carbon budget scenarios‚Äù. Transport The carbon budget scenarios for the energy sector suggest a need to maximise electrification of cars and vans with an associated requirement for expansion of charging infrastructure. The scenarios see a range of between 600,000 to 1.5 million battery electric vehicles by 2030 to meet targets along with 130,000 battery EV vans. ‚ÄúThe more ambitious scenarios for the energy sector would effectively mean all new car registrations would have to be battery electric vehicles before 2030 with significant early scrappage of ICE [internal combustion engine] vehicles. Additional biofuel blending will also be necessary,‚Äù it adds. A reduction in transport demand and mode switching from private car transport to public and active transport could reduce transition costs as well as having important co-benefits related to improving health and easing congestion, the CCAC finds. Land use planning and public transport infrastructure would have an important role to play in this. The CCAC modelling suggests ‚Äúa complete removal of coal and peat for residential heating and up to 600,000 retrofits of houses between 2020 and 2030‚Äù. This means upgrading homes to a B2 energy rating or ‚Äúcost optimal standard‚Äù by 2030, of which 35,000 would be houses owned by local authorities. This would mean an 80 per cent reduction in kerosene use and largescale electrification for home heating, it suggests. Heat pumps or electrification are also foreseen for space heating in the commercial sector. Climate Justice The CCAC stresses the need for climate action in the context of a just transition. ‚ÄúIndividuals and communities who are vulnerable or at risk of loss of employment or livelihood, or disproportionate costs need to be identified and assisted in the transition,‚Äù it adds. The importance of providing policy supports aimed at alternative forms of income for small and medium enterprises, farmers and other impacted households ‚Äúshould be considered urgently‚Äù. The CCAC concludes it is possible to implement carbon budgets while protecting and enhancing biodiversity. ‚ÄúHowever, it is critical further pressure on biodiversity from all aspects of climate mitigation measures is avoided, in particular from poor siting of renewable energy infrastructure and inappropriate land-use change such as over reliance on, or poor siting of, mono-species afforestation,‚Äù it warns. Care must be taken, it adds, to identify and implement measures which deliver ‚Äúsynergistic gains‚Äù for climate mitigation, biodiversity protection and restoration and river catchment resilience by improving water quality. The 51 per cent target applies to GHGs ‚Äúattributable to industrial, agricultural, energy, land use and other anthropogenic activities in the State‚Äù. It does not include emissions from international aviation or shipping but this may be re-considered in the context of the next programme of carbon budgets and international developments in the interim, it says. Dr Cara Augustenborg, environmental scientist and member of the advisory council, described the budgets as ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù, and said ‚Äúwe are officially on the road to bending the emissions curve in Ireland‚Äù. Welcoming the outcome of the council‚Äôs deliberations, Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan said: ‚ÄúWhen we passed the Climate Act in July we embedded the process of carbon budgeting into law. ‚ÄúThe Act also strengthened the role of the Climate Change Advisory Council, to empower this independent body to do this important work, based on the most up-to-date climate science. These first carbon budgets are a significant milestone in our efforts to tackle climate change. ‚ÄúThe first two five-year carbon budgets equate to a total reduction of 51 per cent emissions over the period to 2030. This is part of the journey towards ‚Äònet zero‚Äô, which commits us to the transition to a ‚Äòclimate resilient, biodiversity rich, environmentally sustainable and climate neutral economy‚Äô no later than 2050. ‚ÄúThe Government will shortly publish Climate Action Plan 2021. Every sector of the economy will need to play its part. ‚ÄúThere will be different targets for each sector, based on their respective starting points and the relative difficulty, cost, speed and benefits of reducing emissions. ‚ÄúThis will be challenging and will require fundamental changes in many parts of Irish life, but it is also an opportunity to create a cleaner, greener economy and society that cuts emissions, creates jobs and protects our people and the planet,‚Äù Mr Ryan said.",,10/25/21 16:59,"The Climate Change Advisory Council has finalised its recommendations for two, five-year carbon budgets aimed at reducing the State‚Äôs carbon emissions by 51 per cent by 2030.

The scenarios see a range of between 600,000 to 1.5 million battery electric vehicles by 2030 to meet targets along with 130,000 battery EV vans. ‚ÄúThe more ambitious scenarios for the energy sector would effectively mean all new car registrations would have to be battery electric vehicles before 2030 with significant early scrappage of ICE [internal combustion engine] vehicles. Additional biofuel blending will also be necessary,‚Äù it adds. A reduction in transport demand and mode switching from private car transport to public and active transport could reduce transition costs as well as having important co-benefits related to improving health and easing congestion, the CCAC finds. Land use planning and public transport infrastructure would have an important role to play in this. The CCAC modelling suggests ‚Äúa complete removal of coal and peat for residential heating and up to 600,000 retrofits of houses between 2020 and 2030‚Äù. This means upgrading homes to a B2 energy rating or ‚Äúcost optimal standard‚Äù by 2030, of which 35,000 would be houses owned by local authorities. This would mean an 80 per cent reduction in kerosene use and largescale electrification for home heating, it suggests. Heat pumps or electrification are also foreseen for space heating in the commercial sector. The CCAC stresses the need for climate action in the context of a just transition. ‚ÄúIndividuals and communities who are vulnerable or at risk of loss of employment or livelihood, or disproportionate costs need to be identified and assisted in the transition,‚Äù it adds. The importance of providing policy supports aimed at alternative forms of income for small and medium enterprises, farmers and other impacted households ‚Äúshould be considered urgently‚Äù. The CCAC concludes it is possible to implement carbon budgets while protecting and enhancing biodiversity. ‚ÄúHowever, it is critical further pressure on biodiversity from all aspects of climate mitigation measures is avoided, in particular from poor siting of renewable energy infrastructure and inappropriate land-use change such as over reliance on, or poor siting of, mono-species afforestation,‚Äù it warns. Care must be taken, it adds, to identify and implement measures which deliver ‚Äúsynergistic gains‚Äù for climate mitigation, biodiversity protection and restoration and river catchment resilience by improving water quality. The 51 per cent target applies to GHGs ‚Äúattributable to industrial, agricultural, energy, land use and other anthropogenic activities in the State‚Äù. It does not include emissions from international aviation or shipping but this may be re-considered in the context of the next programme of carbon budgets and international developments in the interim, it says. Dr Cara Augustenborg, environmental scientist and member of the advisory council, described the budgets as ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù, and said ‚Äúwe are officially on the road to bending the emissions curve in Ireland‚Äù. Welcoming the outcome of the council‚Äôs deliberations, Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan said: ‚ÄúWhen we passed the Climate Act in July we embedded the process of carbon budgeting into law. ‚ÄúThe Act also strengthened the role of the Climate Change Advisory Council, to empower this independent body to do this important work, based on the most up-to-date climate science. These first carbon budgets are a significant milestone in our efforts to tackle climate change. ‚ÄúThe first two five-year carbon budgets equate to a total reduction of 51 per cent emissions over the period to 2030. This is part of the journey towards ‚Äònet zero‚Äô, which commits us to the transition to a ‚Äòclimate resilient, biodiversity rich, environmentally sustainable and climate neutral economy‚Äô no later than 2050. ‚ÄúThe Government will shortly publish Climate Action Plan 2021. Every sector of the economy will need to play its part. ‚ÄúThere will be different targets for each sector, based on their respective starting points and the relative difficulty, cost, speed and benefits of reducing emissions. ‚ÄúThis will be challenging and will require fundamental changes in many parts of Irish life, but it is also an opportunity to create a cleaner, greener economy and society that cuts emissions, creates jobs and protects our people and the planet,‚Äù Mr Ryan said.",https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4710186.1635191539!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg,irishtimes

Ngayon nakita natin we were able to defeat Delta (Now, we have seen that we were able to defeat Delta),"" Galvez had said.Vergeire believes Galvez made the statement in the context of earlier projections that the country may mirror the experiences of India and Indonesia, where a surge of Delta cases affected their overall response.""We were expecting talaga na magkakaroon ng sobrang taas na kaso, tayo ay ma-o-overwhelm, marami ang mamamatay, pero hindi po natin naabot 'yung projected number of cases at 'yung overwhelmed [na] health system (We were expecting high cases, that we may get overwhelmed and many will die, but we never reached the projected number),"" she said.She added that while the country' health system was challenged because of the Delta surge, prompt actions by the government led to a reduction of cases one and a half months after the variant was first detected.""Hindi po natin sinasabi na 'natalo' na natin ang Delta, ang Delta po, nandito pa sa atin... pero ang pinakamaganda, we were able to control and reduce the number of cases and naisaayos natin ang (We never said that we 'defeated' Delta, as Delta remained here in the country, but what is good is that we were able to control and reduce the number of cases and we have fixed our) health system capacity,"" Vergeire said.The Philippines has a low-risk classification of Covid-19 with a two-week growth rate of -48 percent and an average daily attack rate of nearly 5.9 cases per 100,000 population.The National Capital Region is under moderate risk with a -53-percent decrease in the two-week growth rate and ADAR of 8.56 cases per 100,000 population.On Monday, the country reported 4,405 new Covid-19 cases for a total of 2.761 million cases.",,10/25/21 17:00,,https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2021/10/26/22598.jpg,manilatimes

Ron DeSantis wants to offer police officers who refuse to get the coronavirus vaccine $5,000 to relocate to Florida, pledging ‚Äúwe will treat you better‚Äù than forces across the country threatening layoffs of those who don‚Äôt want the jab. ‚Äú‚Äã‚ÄãWe‚Äôre actually actively working to recruit out-of-state law enforcement, because we do have needs in our police and our sheriff‚Äôs departments. So, in the next legislative session, I‚Äôm going to hopefully sign legislation that gives a $5,000 bonus to any out-of-state law enforcement that relocates in Florida‚Äã,‚Äù the Republican governor told Maria Bartiromo on ‚ÄúSunday Morning Futures.‚Äù‚Äã Addressing officers in New York, Minneapolis and Seattle, DeSantis told them: ‚Äã‚ÄùIf you‚Äôre not being treated well, we will treat you better here. You can fill important needs for us, and we will compensate you as a result.‚Äã‚Äù‚Äã He also said he was going to convene a special session of the state legislature to block vaccine mandates imposed by federal and local governments. ‚ÄúOur policy is very clear. We‚Äôre going to have a special session, and we‚Äôre going to say, nobody should lose their job based off these injections. It‚Äôs a choice you can make. But we want to make sure we‚Äôre protecting your jobs and your livelihoods,‚Äù DeSantis said. He called front-line workers like nurses, firefighters and police officers heroes for doing their jobs despite the coronavirus. ‚Äã‚Äã ‚ÄúThe nurses we have said have been heroes this whole time, they have been working day in and day out. They couldn‚Äôt do their job on Zoom. They had to be there. And they did it. And they did it with honor and integrity‚Äã,‚Äù he said. ‚Äã ‚Äú‚ÄãNow you have people that want to kick them out of their job over this shot, which is basically a personal decision. And you‚Äôre right. What [President] Biden‚Äôs doing is unconstitutional. He does not have the authority to do this‚Äã,‚Äù DeSantis said. Police departments across the country are requiring their officers to get the COVID vaccine, leading many of them to walk off the job or be fired. In New York, Pat Lynch, president of the Police Benevolent Association, vowed to take Mayor Bill de Blasio to court over his decision to require all city workers, including cops and firefighters, to be vaccinated. ‚ÄúFrom the beginning of the de Blasio administration‚Äòs haphazard vaccine rollout, we have fought to make the vaccine available to every member who chooses it, while also protecting their right to make that personal medical decision in consultation with their own doctor,‚Äù Lynch said in a statement.‚Äã In Seattle, a vaccine mandate has led to a shortage of as many as 500 officers.‚Äã Police in other cities, including Chicago and Minneapolis, ‚Äãhave also refused to abide by the vaccine requirements and have either resigned or been fired. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation‚Äôs top infectious diseases expert, has pleaded with police officers and other public employees to get the shot to protect themselves and others. ‚ÄúMore police officers die of COVID than they do in other causes of death, so it doesn‚Äôt make any sense to not try to protect yourself as well as the colleagues that you work with,‚Äù he said in an interview on ‚Äã‚Äù‚ÄãFox News Sunday‚Äã‚Äù earlier this month. ‚Äã‚Äã According to the Officer Down Memorial Page , 240 law enforcement officers died of COVID this year, more than four times the number of deaths from gunfire. In 2020, 245 officers died of the coronavirus, said the organization, which tracks on-duty police deaths.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/DeSantisCopsVax.jpg?quality=90&strip=all,nypost

They cannot go to restaurants for a meal, travel by plane or train, or attend many sporting and cultural events. Many of them, however, are going to discover they face an even more serious consequence for refusing the vaccine: the loss of their jobs. Vaccination mandates are expanding in scope and number, and they will cover thousands of people. This week, more than 5,000 health-care workers were expected to be placed on unpaid leave because they have yet to receive a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by the Oct. 26 deadline. Already more than 1,700 long-term care staff ‚Äì including almost 400 nurses ‚Äì have been placed on leave because of their non-vaccinated status. It is puzzling why so many people with scientific training have refused the vaccine. In long-term care, the refusal rate is the same for both nurses and food service employees. To estimate how many other employees in other sectors with looming vaccination mandates may soon be out of a job, it is useful to look at the numbers in both the health-care sector and the long-term care sector. The vaccination rates among employees in both sectors is around 96% (although only 93% in the Interior). On the one hand, that is an impressively high figure but on the other, it also translates into literally thousands and thousands of unvaccinated staff potentially losing employment. For example, there are roughly 130,000 employees in B.C.‚Äôs health-care sector. This includes all medical staff, support staff and administration. So while an unvaccinated rate of just 4% seems small, when it is applied to such a large pool of people, it can produce a big number. Hence, the 5,000-plus health-care workers placed on unpaid leave. If that 4% unvaccinated rate turns out to be the average in other sectors, that works out to roughly 1,200 B.C. government employees losing their jobs on Nov. 22, when their mandate takes effect and about 240 Vancouver civic workers suffering the same fate on Dec. 6. Of course, these numbers will be much smaller if enough people covered by these mandates come to their senses and get a vaccine that has been proven safe and effective for billions of people around the world. In addition, it is reasonable to think that many unvaccinated people, when faced with the harsh reality that accompanies the loss of a paying job and financial benefits, will do just that. Perhaps the federal government‚Äôs announcement that these folks will not qualify for unemployment insurance will cause some to reconsider. We can only hope so. In the meantime, it will be interesting to see how many school districts impose their own vaccine mandates on teachers and other school workers. If the 4% average for unvaccinated staff that we‚Äôve seen in health care is mirrored in the K-12 sector, hundreds of teachers could be added to the ‚Äúon leave‚Äù crowd. The consequences for refusing the vaccine are getting harsher.

NYC workers vaccine mandate protest shuts down Brooklyn Bridge traffic into Manhattan,https://www.foxnews.com/us/nyc-workers-protest-vaccine-mandate-in-brooklyn-bridge-march,,['Pilar Arias'],,New York City municipal employees are marching across the Brooklyn Bridge Monday against the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.,,10/25/21 17:43,"close Video Vivek Ramaswamy: Vaccine mandate protests are the result of rampant lies on COVID-19 by public officials The ‚ÄòOutnumbered‚Äô panel reacts to protests over vaccine mandates in New York City and CDC Director Walensky‚Äôs comments about education for the unvaccinated New York City municipal employees are marching across the Brooklyn Bridge Monday against the COVID-19 vaccine mandate. The protest, which is set to end in front of City Hall on the Manhattan side of the bridge, is billed as an anti-mandate protest on behalf of nearly 50,000 NYC employees who have yet to be vaccinated with a deadline just days away. Traffic is shut down on the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan as of 11:49 a.m., according to police. NYC'S BARCLAY'S CENTER SWARMED BY PROTESTERS SUPPORTING NETS' KYRIE IRVING'S REFUSAL TO BE VACCINATED PIX11 reports all city workers must have their first shot of the coronavirus vaccine by 5 p.m. Friday if they want to come to work the morning of Nov. 1. Monday's protest follows a protest Sunday night at the Barclay's Center in support of Kyrie Irving. A crowd of people rallied as the Brooklyn Nets lost to the Charlotte Hornets at their home opener without their point guard. At one point the protest turned violent when some demonstrators tried to break into the arena, clashing with security and police. Irving has refused to get vaccinated. As a result, he's not getting paid. The same could soon be said for thousands of city workers if they don't get the shot by Friday. That's the threat from Mayor Bill de Blasio with vaccination rates lagging behind the general population at several large city agencies including the NYPD and the FDNYP. NEW YORK CITY POLICE UNION THREATENS LEGAL ACTION OVER DE BLASIO VACCINE MANDATE ""It's time now. If you don't want to get vaccinated, you'll be put on unpaid leave. Well, the vast majority of human beings go to work to get paid. And also, I think for a lot of our first responders, there's a calling. They believe in the work, they care about the work. Those two factors I think are going to cause the vast majority to get vaccinated,"" Mayor de Blasio said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The mayor did offer a $500 incentive for city workers to get vaccinated and even that's causing controversy, with several unions now demanding back pay for workers who already got vaccinated without a bonus.

The province currently has 90 active cases of novel coronavirus with one person in hospital as a result of the infection. Officials also say they are continuing to investigate the source of the latest cluster of infections in the Marystown, N.L., area.

"B.C. restaurants, food sector struggling with staffing as COVID-19 measures ease",https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2021/10/25/bc-restaurants-staffing-capacity/,,['Hana Mae Nassar'],,"While capacity limits have been lifted in parts of B.C. for a number of businesses, you may still find yourself waiting while out for a bite or drink.","While capacity limits have been lifted in parts of B.C. for a number of businesses and gatherings, you may still find yourself waiting while out for a bite or drink. According to the Alliance of Beverage Licensees, the industry is still facing a number of challenges, though the scaling back of COVID-19 measures is welcome news. ‚ÄúWe estimate we‚Äôre about 40,000 workers short right now. So, if you‚Äôre out there and you‚Äôre wondering why it takes longer to get service at your favourite restaurant, bar, or pub, we‚Äôre struggling with that as well. We‚Äôre doing the best we can with inadequate staffing,‚Äù explained Jeff Guignard, ABLE BC executive director. The staffing shortage, he says, is expected to be a longer term challenge, with a few factors adding to struggles. ‚ÄúThe hospitality industry has relied upon foreign workers in a lot of places,‚Äù he explained, pointing to travel measures brought on by the pandemic, through which many countries moved to shut down borders to non-essential travel to limit the spread of the virus. Related articles: B.C.‚Äôs capacity limits lifted on restaurants, arenas, concerts, and more B.C. event planners, tourism industry looking forward to lifted capacity limits B.C. doctors group opposes lifting COVID-19-related capacity limits on events Second, Guignard notes the sector was ‚Äúessentially shut down‚Äù for about a year, meaning many people lost their jobs. Many of them went on to find new employment. Finally, he says there are the select few who have been taking advantage of federal and provincial aid programs, despite many businesses paying more. ‚ÄúYes, sometimes that comes with costs for us as well, and we‚Äôre in a low-margin business that‚Äôs been losing money for a while, so we do have to pass off some of those costs to customers, of course, and we‚Äôre hoping everyone will be understanding about that.‚Äù The food services and hospitality sectors have been hard hit through the pandemic, with many businesses operating at an overall loss over the past year. Guignard says everyone is anxious to get back to normal. ‚ÄúWe wish these steps were going faster,‚Äù he admitted on Monday. ‚ÄúBut at the end of the day, today is really good news for our industry.‚Äù As of Monday, there are no longer capacity restrictions for venues that require proof of vaccination in many parts of the province, meaning businesses are able to fill their establishments to 100 per cent capacity if they are checking for B.C. Vaccine Cards. As part of the scaling back of COVID-19 measures, patrons are able to now mingle between tables, no longer being forced to stay in their seats while out. Venues are allowed to determine their own table limits, and there are no longer any restrictions on liquor sale hours. Measures still remain However, some measures remain. People are still required to wear masks in indoor public spaces, dancing is still not permitted, and full vaccination is required to access certain non-essential businesses, services, and events. Pandemic rules are also not being relaxed across the province. Regional restrictions remain for the Interior Health, Northern Health, and Fraser East regions due to high COVID-19 case numbers and low vaccination rates. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been losing money, we‚Äôve barely broken even for the past 18 to 20 months,‚Äù said Guignard of struggles the industry has faced. ‚ÄúAll of these restrictions have, accidentally, been really borne by the hospitality industry, people on the frontlines, right? We haven‚Äôt been able to host events properly, we haven‚Äôt been able to be at full capacity, we‚Äôve had to check vaccine passports and so many of those things, which has been difficult.‚Äù He believes the lifting of restrictions is a step in the right direction. However, he says there are still some challenges workers and businesses will have to navigate, pointing to the dancing restrictions and their impacts on places like nightclubs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been very difficult to help customers understand, especially now that everyone‚Äôs double vaccinated ‚Ä¶ why you can‚Äôt dance,‚Äù Guignard explained. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got back to standing and mingling, that‚Äôs a good step, and I think we‚Äôll get back to dancing fairly soon. Even just the simple fact of allowing people to stand up is taking tremendous pressure off staff who have had to go around the room over, and over, and over again to remind people they‚Äôre not allowed to stand.‚Äù -With files from Claire Fenton",10/25/21 17:56,,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/9/2021/05/21/Restauraunts-indoors-Vancouver-1024x580.png,citynews1130

US details new international COVID-19 travel requirements,https://www.nsnews.com/coronavirus-covid-19-national-news/us-details-new-international-covid-19-travel-requirements-4548616,,['Canadian Press'],,WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî Two weeks before a new vaccination requirement kicks in for most foreign travelers to the U.S.,,10/25/21 18:03,"WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî Two weeks before a new vaccination requirement kicks in for most foreign travelers to the U.S., the Biden administration detailed the new international COVID-19 air travel polices, including exemptions for kids, and new federal contact tracing requirements. Beginning on Nov. 8, foreign, non-immigrant adults traveling to the United States will need to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, with limited exceptions, and all travelers will need to be tested for the virus before boarding an aircraft to the U.S., with tightened restrictions for those who are not fully vaccinated. The new policy comes as the Biden administration moves away from broader country-based travel restrictions and bans toward what it terms a ‚Äúvaccinations-based‚Äù system focused on the individual risk of the traveler. It almost reflects the White House's embrace of vaccination requirements in an effort to drive more Americans to get vaccinated by piling on inconveniences to those remaining without a shot. Under the policy, those who are unvaccinated will need to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test within a day of travel, while those who are vaccinated will be allowed to present a test taken within three days of travel. Children under 18 will not be required to be fully vaccinated, given the inconsistency in the global roll-out of shots for their age cohort, but those aged 2 and over will be subjected to the same COVID-19 testing policy as their parent or guardian. The Biden administration has been working with airlines, who will be required to enforce the new procedures, to explain the new policies so they can prepare for implementation. Airlines will be mandated to verify vaccine records and match them against identify information. They will also need to make certain that the shots given are on the Food and Drug Administration or World Health Organization's approved list. Mixing-and-matching of approved shots will be permitted. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's quarantine officers will spot-check passengers after arrival in the U.S. for compliance, according to an administration official. Airlines that don't enforce the requirements could be subject to penalties of up to nearly $35,000 per violation. The administration announced limited exceptions to the vaccination requirement, including children, those who participated in COVID-19 clinical trials, who have medical reasons for not getting vaccinated, or are from a country where shots are not widely available. Unvaccinated residents of countries with vaccination rates below 10% of adults may be admitted to the U.S. with a government letter authorizing travel for pressing, non-tourism purposes, the administration said. CDC is also requiring airlines to collect contact information for international air travelers regardless of vaccination status to facilitate contact tracing.

On Monday, there was an all-time high of 37,930 new cases, along with 1,069 additional deaths, according to the country's coronavirus task force . ""There is a real war in the red zone in hospitals throughout the country,"" Dr. Denis Protsenko, the country's chief coronavirus doctor, wrote on his Telegram social media account ""Look at the number of free beds and a lot will fall into place."" Protsenko is the head doctor at the Kommunarka infection disease hospital in Moscow, Municipal officials say since September, cases in Russia's capital have risen by 30 per cent each week and are hovering around 8,000 a day ‚Äî a trajectory that Mayor Sergey Sobyanin has acknowledged is a ""worst-case scenario."" Alexander Lobanov of Moscow will turn 60 a few days after new coronavirus restrictions kick in. He is unvaccinated and could face a four-month stay-at-home order unless he gets the shot. (Briar Stewart/CBC) To try to curb the spread, the city is bringing in a partial lockdown that will begin Thursday. As of Monday, it is ordering anyone over the age of 60 to stay home until Feb. 25 if they haven't been vaccinated or previously infected with COVID-19 during the past six months. On his website, Sobyanin made a plea to grandparents to get vaccinated, pointing out that the vaccination rate for those older than 60 is slightly more than 30 per cent in Moscow, while that demographic makes up 86 per cent of those dying in the city's hospitals. In an effort to increase vaccinations among that age group and those with chronic illnesses, the city of 12 million is imposing tough restrictions that kick in on Oct. 25 for those who haven't been vaccinated or previously infected. They are supposed to stay at home for four months, but are allowed out for walks and exercise. Artyom Sabirov, the manger at Uilliam's restaurant in Moscow, said it is disappointing to be closing again especially after getting a Michelin recommendation. (Briar Stewart/CBC) It's not clear how the order will be enforced, but during the first lockdown in the spring of 2020, Maria Markova said public health officials called to check up on her to make sure she was at home. The 73-year-old, who had COVID-19 in 2020, isn't vaccinated and said it's because of underlying health conditions. ""I don't think it is right that they force people,"" Markova told CBC as she was out for a walk near the Moscow river on Friday. ""The pensioners and the older people are the target again? This is totally unacceptable."" Alexander Lobanov, who is turning 60 on Nov. 1, spoke to CBC as he was riding his bike nearby. He is also unvaccinated, but is resigned to the fact that he may have to get it. ""I feel like I have no choice now,"" he said. A medical specialist works in the intensive care unit of the City Clinical Hospital Number 52, where people suffering from COVID-19 are treated in Moscow on Oct. 21, 2021. (Maxim Shemtov/Reuters) With more than 1,000 people dying of COVID-19 every day for the past 10 days and with vaccination rates lagging, Russia has declared a non-working week from Nov. 1 to Nov. 7. It coincides with statutory holidays on Nov. 4 and 5 for Unity Day, which commemorates a 1612 uprising against Polish and Lithuanian forces. In addition to the non-working week, Moscow is imposing a partial lockdown between Oct. 28 and Nov. 7. During this period, all non-essential stores will be closed and dining in at restaurants will be banned, but public transport will continue to run. 11 days of restrictions Theatres and museums will also keep operating but at 50 per cent capacity and all visitors will be required to show a vaccination QR code or proof they have had a recent COVID-19 infection. The measures are slated to only last for 11 days and the mayor said the restrictions are akin to taking an aspirin for a fever. The pill won't cure the illness, he wrote, but it gives the body a break. ""Let's take a little rest and help preserve the lives and health of many people,"" he wrote. Some other cities, including St. Petersburg, which is also going into a partial lockdown on Oct. 30, are making it mandatory for all public places like restaurants and gyms to require guests to have a QR code. However, Moscow isn't requiring that. Moscow resident Elena Romanchenko, 34, isn't vaccinated and says no one in her family is. (Briar Stewart/CBC) Officials enacted that measure in June, but cancelled it after three weeks because of pressure from the hospitality industry. In the wealthy Moscow neighbourhood of Patriarch Ponds, streets are lined with upscale restaurants, including Uilliams, which was one of nearly 70 eateries in the city recognized by the French Michelin guide last week. The recommendation would normally be a boon for reservations, but Uilliam's, an Italian restaurant, is getting ready to shut its doors to customers. ""I guess it's necessary and maybe it will even help,"" said 28-year-old Artyom Sabirov, the manager at Uilliams. ""The main thing is it doesn't drag on for too long like it did two years ago."" Hesitation over restrictions While officials in Russia have been hesitant to institute restrictions, the climbing cases and deaths are taking a toll on hospitals and medical staff. In the Siberian town of Biysk, 3,000 kilometres southeast of Moscow, there are reports that some hospital staff are having to work 72 hours straight in order to keep up with the number of COVID-19 patients being admitted. The town also had to build an additional morgue. In Biysk, like elsewhere in Russia, vaccination rates are low. Across the country, slightly more than 40 per cent of adults have had two doses of a vaccine, according to Gogov, which tallies statistics from across Russia. Pavel Volchkov, a scientist with the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, believes the partial lockdown in the city will bring the climbing COVID-19 case rate down. (Briar Stewart/CBC) The Sputnik V shot, which Russia unveiled in August 2020, hasn't been cleared for use in anyone under the age of 18, so the country's approximately 30 million children remain unvaccinated. Despite pleas from government officials, including President Vladimir Putin who got the Sputnik jab, the vaccination rate has stalled. On Oct. 21, Putin reiterated that he doesn't support mandatory vaccinations, but stressed that people only have two options, ""get sick or get vaccinated."" Much stronger words are being used by the pro-Kremlin broadcaster, Dmitry Kiselyov, 67, who hosts a weekly news program, Vesti Nedeli . Normally, he uses the airtime to criticize Western governments and culture, but recently he has been railing against Russia's unvaccinated Kiselyov, who said he was vaccinated in January, was hospitalized with coronavirus last month. Sputnik vaccine not approved yet by WHO ""To refuse getting the vaccine can't be called anything but sociopathic behaviour,"" he said on his Sunday news program. ""The lion's share of state funds are going to treat the unvaccinated. The unvaccinated don't want to take any responsibility."" While multiple research studies, including one published in the medical journal The Lancet, have pointed to the effectiveness of the Sputnik vaccine, it hasn't yet been approved by the World Health Organization. In Russia, those refusing to get the jab include those who don't trust the government shot and those who don't support vaccination in general. Elena Romachenko, 34, told CBC that a person can control their own health. ""Eat well, do sports, "" she said. ""Go to the resort, the sea, the mountains, then you will be healthy."" WATCH | What is the future of COVID-19? What is the future of COVID-19? Likely as a seasonal illness, epidemiologist says 1 day ago 0:48 Dr. Doug Manuel, senior scientist with The Ottawa Hospital, says COVID-19 is likely to remain endemic in the community, with seasonal waves that show up each year. 0:48 Pavel Volchkov, head of a genomic engineering laboratory at Moscow's Institute of Physics and Technology, believes most vaccine holdouts aren't against vaccines, but think they don't need them. ""I call it the superhero syndrome,"" Volchkov told CBC. ""They believe if they were able to resist COVID-19 during the past year and a half, that SARS-CoV-2 won't be able to infect them."" Volchkov, who helped develop COVID-19 tests during the early days of the pandemic, believes countries need to take a stricter approach such as occurred in China and Australia, which locked down entire regions after the detection of a small number of cases. He thinks obligatory vaccination is part of the answer but believes it would be unpopular and untenable in most countries. COVID-19 deaths are surging in Russia, but vaccination lags Seeking travel freedom, Russians flock to Serbia for Western-made COVID-19 vaccines Russia has plenty of COVID-19 vaccine doses. What's missing is trust As for Russia, he said in order to have ""good population immunity,"" 70 per cent or more would have to be vaccinated. As children can't currently be immunized in the country, that means all adults would have to be. And with more than half of them unwilling to get a shot, he said the government has no choice but to institute restrictions every time the hospitals get close to being overwhelmed.",,cbc
Can I get a booster shot? Latest guidelines for COVID-19 vaccines,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-booster-shots-pfizer-moderna-johnson-and-johnson/,,,,"The CDC recently recommended additional doses for millions of Americans, including all adults who were first vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson's shot.",,10/25/21 18:37,"Up to 99 million Americans are now eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot, after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week signed off on sweeping new booster recommendations for recipients of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson's vaccines . Those recommendations came after the Food and Drug Administration updated their emergency use authorizations to allow boosters for all three vaccines. The FDA is also allowing eligible Americans to mix-and-match their booster shots, which means you can choose to receive an additional dose from any of the three brands that are available. Here's what we know so far: Johnson & Johnson recipients The CDC now recommends a booster shot for all adults who were vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 vaccine at least two months ago. That comes after the FDA concluded that even the highest estimates of the single-shot vaccine's protection were ""consistently less"" than the mRNA-based vaccines from Pfizer or Moderna. Data presented to the FDA's outside vaccine advisers by Johnson & Johnson says vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 climbed to 94% in the U.S. after a booster shot. A group of the CDC's vaccine advisers also concluded that the risks of rare but serious side effects following a second dose of the vaccine were ""unlikely to be greater"" than after the first dose. However, some of the agency's outside vaccine advisers said they would probably counsel their patients at higher risk of a rare blood clotting side effect linked to the Janssen vaccine to opt for a dose of Pfizer or Moderna instead. Out of more than 15 million recipients in the U.S. of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, the CDC and FDA have confirmed close to 50 reports of the condition known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Most were women under 50 years old. ""I was personally not going to recommend a booster dose of the same product of Janssen, so I'm glad that we have included the mix-and-match,"" Dr. Pablo Sanchez, one of the CDC's vaccine advisers, said last week at the committee's meeting to discuss booster shots. Pfizer and Moderna recipients Currently, all seniors 65 and older who received Pfizer or Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines are recommended to get a booster shot at least six months after they were first vaccinated. The CDC also expanded eligibility for adults ages 18 and up who were vaccinated six months ago if they live in ""long-term care settings,"" have ""underlying medical conditions,"" or are working or living in ""high-risk settings"" like prisons, hospitals or homeless shelters. People at higher risk of exposure from their jobs ‚Äî including teachers and school support staff, grocery clerks, postal workers, factory workers, public transit crews, police and first responders, and others ‚Äî are also eligible. Like with earlier booster shot recommendations for immunocompromised recipients , most pharmacies and providers are relying only on people's ""self-attestation"" and not requiring proof of eligibility for the additional shots. FDA and CDC officials say they could further expand eligibility for booster shots soon as authorities gather more data on the need and potential risks. ""There is evidence to suggest potentially that lowering the age of those eligible for boosters may make sense in the future. Something we're looking at closely,"" Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA's top vaccines official, told reporters last week. Those risks include myocarditis and pericarditis, rare heart side effects linked to the mRNA-based Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that have occurred mostly in young males. These cases have been mostly mild and typically resolve within a day, according to federal health officials, but often require hospitalization. Data presented to the CDC's outside vaccine advisers last week suggested the risk of myocarditis could be ""slightly increased"" in adults under 30 after Moderna's first two doses compared to Pfizer's. However, some experts hope Moderna's decision to halve the size of its booster dose ‚Äî 50 micrograms instead of the 100 micrograms of its first two shots ‚Äî could cut the risk of myocarditis after the booster. Data from Pfizer's booster rollout in Israel, which was presented to the FDA's vaccine advisers earlier this month , also suggests the risk of myocarditis was lower after the third dose while effectively curbing a surge in COVID-19 cases there. ""We may well get there. It's a matter of having the data, and ensuring that when we make that decision, the benefits clearly outweigh the risks throughout the population,"" Marks said. Mix-and-match boosters The FDA's decision to allow for mixing-and-matching booster shots was based in part on early data from trials led by the National Institutes of Health which suggest all combinations of so-called ""heterologous"" boosting are safe and effective at increasing protection. Federal health officials also pointed to situations that made requirements to match booster shot brands tricky, like when people do not remember which shots they were first vaccinated with, had a bad reaction to their initial vaccinations, or do not have access to the same brand at their nearby pharmacies. So far, the FDA's scientists concluded there is not enough data from the NIH's trial to pick a ""preferred strategy"" for boosting. The study's scientists had cautioned that their trial was not designed to ""directly compare"" the immune response triggered by different booster combinations. ""We will not articulate a preference. My understanding is that most people will have done largely well with the initial vaccine that they got and may express a preference, very much, for the original vaccine series they got, having done very well,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters last week . ""There may be some people who might prefer another vaccine over the one that they received, and the current CDC recommendations now make that possible.""

There was no way to meet the demand,‚Äù industry expert Douglas Stein said told CNN. ‚ÄúBut that opened the floodgates for all the nefarious behavior.‚Äù Stein described the medical-grade nitrile gloves as the ‚Äúmost dangerous commodity on Earth right now.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an enormous amount of bad product coming in. An endless stream of filthy, second-hand and substandard gloves coming into the US of which federal authorities, it seems, are only now beginning to understand the enormous scale,‚Äù he said. A criminal investigation surrounding the operation is now underway by authorities in Thailand and America. Miami businessman Tarek Kirschen was one of the US distributors who unwittingly ordered the unsanitary gloves. Kirschen told CNN he ordered about $2 million worth of gloves from Thai-based company Paddy the Room late last year. ‚ÄúWe start getting phone calls from clients completely upset, and you know, yelling and screaming at us saying, ‚ÄòHey, you screwed us,‚Äô‚Äù he told the outlet. ‚ÄúThese were reused gloves. They were washed, recycled,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSome of them were dirty. Some of them had bloodstains. Some of them had markers on them with dates from two years ago ‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes.‚Äù Kirschen said he tossed the gloves, refunded the money to his customers, and alerted the FDA in February 2021. He stressed none of the second-hand protective gloves he ordered were used in medical settings. However, the CNN investigation found that American distributors bought around 200 million gloves from Paddy the Room. It‚Äôs unclear what happened to those gloves after they entered the country. US Customs and Border Protection told CNN it had seized about 40 million counterfeit face masks and hundreds of thousands of other PPE items ‚Äî but the agency says it does not count the specific amount of glove seizures. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security began ‚ÄúOperation Stolen Promise‚Äù with the aim of stopping the flow of illicit PPE into the US. DHS Investigations Special Operations Agent Mike Rose told CNN the agency had made 2,000 seizures of supposed COVID-19-related treatments and PPE. ‚ÄúI think DHS has been a model around the world for how best to coordinate efforts among different agencies to really stop the import, the transactions and all the other surrounding criminal activity around COVID,‚Äù Rose insisted to the outlet.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Medicalgloves.jpg?quality=90&strip=all,nypost

The high court's order came while hearing a PIL initiated on its own on violation of Covid-19 protocols in various markets in the national capital. The high court said it does not want to see penalties being collected from people for violation of Covid-19 norms but it wants that the crowd is being managed nicely by the authorities. We expect from the respondents (Centre, Delhi government and Delhi Police) that these guidelines, Standard Operating Procedure (SoP), Covid appropriate behaviour, and controlling of the crowd at market places will be executed by them scrupulously in this festive season,"" a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh said. All the steps mentioned by the authorities in their respective status reports must be taken and a further status report is filed by them before the next date of hearing on November 30, the bench said. ""Your guidelines, SoP, and protocol must be followed very scrupulously. See this is festival season. Strict compliance is required,"" the bench told the counsel for both the governments. The court said it was keeping the matter pending as it wants to see how the authorities are controlling the situation. The court noted that in the status reports, the authorities have mentioned the steps taken by them on COVID appropriate behaviour and how to control the crowd at marketplaces as well as for engagement of volunteers for implementation of guidelines and sanitization of public utilities. The Centre was represented through Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma and standing counsel Anil Soni. The Delhi government's counsel submitted that they have timely issued appropriate guidelines and had also shut down markets where it was found that protocols were not being followed properly. To this, the court said the authorities should ensure that these guidelines, which have been nicely drafted, are strictly complied with. The Central government had earlier informed the high that it has asked all states and Union territories (UT) to ensure strict compliance with the national directives for Covid-19 management and take necessary measures under the Disaster Management Act. The Centre had also stated that while the opening of activities after a decline in Covid-19 cases was essential, the states and UTs must ensure that ""the whole process is carefully calibrated"". The high court, in June, had initiated proceedings on its own after taking note of certain photographs sent to one of its judges on WhatsApp by an AIIMS doctor showing scant regard for Covid-19 protocols by street vendors in markets.

Moe made the comment while delivering a state of the province address in Saskatoon to members of the city's chamber of commerce. He says COVID-19 vaccines are widely available, so his Saskatchewan Party government will not impose lockdowns or restrictions that could lead to business closures. Some medical experts and the Canadian Medical Association have been calling for restrictions on gathering sizes as hospitals continue to admit a high number of COVID-19 patients. Data from the Saskatchewan Health Authority for this month shows Saskatchewan has had the most residents in intensive care units per capita than any other province at any point in the pandemic. Last week, the province's chief medical health officer, Dr. Saqib Shahab, said COVID-19 vaccines are not enough to stop Saskatchewan's fourth wave.

Over the coming months, the US will be withdrawing its remaining troops from Iraq, currently standing at around 2,500. The withdrawal may also turn ugly and that the old threats may resurface. Indeed, the UN assesses that there are approximately 10,000 Daesh fighters in Syria and Iraq combined. The UN has warned that Daesh has been using the Covid-19 crisis to re-group and consolidate power in the region once again. Once the US withdraws completely, Daesh fighters may use the limbo to try to increase its power and influence in the territories as before. Thousands of Yazidis trapped in the Sinjar mountains as they tried to escape from Daesh in August ... [+] 2014. (Photo credit: Emrah Yorulmaz/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) 2014 Anadolu Agency The world should not forget the atrocities perpetrated by Daesh fighters against religious minorities in Syria and Iraq in 2014 and in the years that followed. Those atrocities include murder, enslavement, deportation and forcible transfer of population, imprisonment, torture, abduction of women and children, exploitation, abuse, rape, sexual violence, sexual slavery and much more. The atrocities committed by Daesh are now recognized as crimes against humanity, war crimes and even genocide, the crime of crimes. The world cannot forget the particular wickedness of the atrocities. Video footage of beheadings, of kidnapped victims thrown from high buildings or burnt alive. These graphic images will be difficult to forget. Until this day, some 2,763 Yazidi women and children are still missing, whether in unknown location or dead. The UN has been warning about the ongoing threat posed by Daesh and its attempts to grow in power yet again, including by abusing the instability brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the fact that Iraq declared victory over Daesh back in 2017, Daesh fighters have been present in the region in the years since. They continue to emerge periodically. Because of that, for example, in August 2021, Iraq launched a security operation to hunt down Daesh militants north of the capital Baghdad. Reportedly , Daesh militants ‚Äúhave an active presence in Tarmiyah district, 50 kilometers north of Baghdad, from where they launch attacks inside the Iraqi capital.‚Äù In early 2021, Alliance defense ministers have agreed to significantly raise the number of troops for the NATO Mission in Iraq, reportedly, from 500 to 4,000 . However, this is still far from the assessed number of Daesh fighters and their capability to recruit new members, as we have seen in 2013 and 2014. If the withdrawal from Iraq happens at the end of 2021, States must have a comprehensive action plan to prevent the disaster that we have witnessed in Afghanistan (mindful of the differences between the states but mindful of the risks involved). States must be ready to act to prevent the atrocities against religious minorities in Iraq, minorities which were subjected to genocidal atrocities only a few years ago. This is the time that States must act on the promise of Never Again and prevent avoidable atrocities against religious minorities.

The number of new cases nationally has been plummeting since the delta surge peaked in mid-September. The U.S. is averaging about 73,000 new cases per day, less than half of the nearly 173,000 recorded on Sept. 13. And the number of Americans in the hospital with COVID-19 has plummeted by about half to around 47,000 since early September. In Florida, Miami-Dade County's mask mandate could be loosened by the end of October if the encouraging numbers continue. A high school outside Boston became the first in Massachusetts to make masks optional after it hit a state vaccination threshold. With about 95% of eligible people at Hopkinton High inoculated, school leaders voted to allow vaccinated students and staff to go maskless for a three-week trial period starting Nov. 1. Still, there are some troubling indicators, including the onset of cold weather, which sends people indoors, where the virus can more easily spread. With required mask use reduced in much of the U.S., the University of Washington's influential COVID-19 forecasting model is predicting increasing infections and hospitalizations in November. Also, COVID-19 deaths per day have begun to creep back up again after a decline that started in late September. Deaths are running at about 1,700 per day, up from close to 1,500 two weeks ago. In sparsely populated Wyoming, which has one of the nation‚Äôs lowest vaccination rates , hospitals are coping with more patients than at any other point in the pandemic. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a war zone,‚Äù public health officer Dr. Mark Dowell told a county health board about the situation at Wyoming Medical Center, the Casper Star Tribune reported. ‚ÄúThe ICU is overrun.‚Äù The vast majority of hospitalized patients in Wyoming haven't gotten the vaccine, the state's vaccination rate is only about 43%. Only West Virginia ranks lower. In rural Minnesota, a man waited two days for an intensive care bed and later died. Bob Cameron, 87, had gone to to his hometown hospital in Hallock with severe gastrointestinal bleeding and COVID-19. Officials searched for space in a larger center. The bleeding exhausted the hospital‚Äôs blood supply, and state troopers drove 130 miles (209 kilometers) with new units, but his condition worsened after surgery and he died Oct. 13, t he Minneapolis Star Tribune reported . ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt say for certain, of course, that if he got to an ICU bed sooner that he would have survived, but we just feel in our hearts that he would have,‚Äù said Cameron‚Äôs granddaughter, Janna Curry. During a three-week stretch this month, rural hospitals in Minnesota were caring for more COVID-19 patients than those in the state‚Äôs major urban center, Minneapolis-St. Paul. The strain on hospitals in Colorado forced a second county to reinstitute an indoor mask mandate last week, the Denver Post reported . Nearly 80% of COVID-19 patients in Colorado hospitals are unvaccinated.

Gottlieb says kids could start getting COVID vaccine as soon as November 4,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-kids-ages-5-11-november-gottlieb-face-the-nation/,,,,Gottlieb said the Biden administration is making the effort to push the vaccine directly into pediatricians' offices.,,10/25/21 19:45,"Former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb predicted Sunday on ""Face the Nation"" that the Biden administration could begin rolling out COVID-19 vaccines for children as soon as November 4 or 5, right after a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel will decide whether to allow Pfizer's vaccine for children ages 5 to 11. Gottlieb said the Biden administration is making the effort to push the vaccine directly into pediatricians' offices. Pfizer, which Gottlieb sits on the board, is developing a small tray that carries 10 vials at a time and a storage container that is small enough for small to medium-sized pediatrician's office to stock the vaccine and deliver it. Transcript: Dr. Scott Gottlieb on ""Face the Nation"", October 24, 2021 ""It could be stored in a regular refrigerator for up to 10 weeks. It was purposely packaged that way,"" Gottlieb said. ""And so, the idea is to try to get it into pediatrician's offices because we know that getting children vaccinated is a much more consultative endeavor."" Gottlieb said many parents may not want to drag their children into a mass vaccination site or pharmacy and would rather have their children in the comfort of their own pediatrician's office. Dr. Scott Gottlieb on ""Face the Nation"" on October 24, 2021. CBS News Pfizer and BioNTech asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine for children 5 to 11 in early October. On Friday, scientists at the FDA said that the likely benefits of giving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to 5- to 11-year-olds far outweigh the potential risks, such as heart inflammation. On Tuesday, the FDA's advisory panel will meet to review the data and evidence of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in children, and vote on whether the FDA should authorize the use. ""If Pfizer does get the authorization on Tuesday from FDA, even before the CDC votes on this on November 2 and 3, they'll start to ship it into the supply chain so it will be available for use once there is a hopefully positive vote from CDC, said Gottlieb. So, it could be as early as November 4 and 5 that you can go into some locations and get your child vaccinated,"" he said. Although kids are at a lower risk of having a severe outcome due to contracting the virus, many have been hospitalized. According to the CDC , at least 731 children have died from COVID-19, including 160 deaths in the 5- to 11-year-old age range. Coronavirus Crisis More Can I get a booster shot?

NYC police union sues city over vaccine mandate,https://www.foxnews.com/us/nyc-police-union-vaccine,,['Louis Casiano'],,New York City's largest police union filed a lawsuit against the city Monday in an effort to overturn a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for its members.,,10/25/21 20:00,"close Video Vivek Ramaswamy: Vaccine mandate protests are the result of rampant lies on COVID-19 by public officials The ‚ÄòOutnumbered‚Äô panel reacts to protests over vaccine mandates in New York City and CDC Director Walensky‚Äôs comments about education for the unvaccinated New York City 's largest police union filed a lawsuit against the city Monday in an effort to overturn a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for its members. The Police Benevolent Association filed the suit in Staten Island Supreme Court and plans to file a request for a temporary injunction preventing the city from imposing the mandate while the lawsuit is pending.

New York City will require police officers, firefighters and other municipal workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or be placed on unpaid leave. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) The move came after Mayor Bill de Blasio announced last week that all city workers would be required to get vaccinated or be placed on unpaid leave or terminated after the Oct. 29 deadline. There is no option to undergo weekly COVID-19 testing. The PBA said the mandate violates its members' right to make their own medical decisions. ""The Vaccine Mandate will impose irreparable harm on police officers. A police officer with sincerely held medical, health, or religious concerns with the vaccine will face irreparable harm if forced to submit to vaccination prior to the Court‚Äôs determination whether a the Vaccine Mandate is unlawful,"" the lawsuit states. ""These officers have rights to medical autonomy and religious observance that would be violated by forcing them to submit to a vaccination. Once a vaccination occurs, that bell cannot be un-rung."" Nearly 70% of New York Police Department employees are vaccinated while more than 60 employees have died from COVID-19 .

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor Bill de Blasio each received COVID-19 boosters Monday as part of their efforts to promote widespread vaccinations. (Office of the New York Mayor via AP) On Monday, de Blasio said the requirement will most likely increase vaccination rates. ""We've seen the mandates move a lot more people to get vaccinated,"" he said. The mayor got vaccinated in March but received a Moderna booster shot Monday during his press briefing. Nearly 12 million doses have been administered citywide, he said. Fox News has reached out to his office. In a letter to members on Monday, the PBA said NYPD leaders have not given specifics on the implementation of the mandate. ""The universal response has been that they are waiting to hear from City Hall,"" the letter said. ""Once again, it is clear that the NYPD is being run directly by Mayor de Blasio and his advisors, who care more about politics than public health or public safety."" ""NYPD members are frustrated because we are trying to make important, possibly life-changing decisions while our leaders keep us in the dark ‚Äì perhaps intentionally,"" the union added. Other unions have sued the city over the vaccine mandate. Earlier this month, a judge declined to grant a temporary injunction requested by teachers and staff of the Department of Education over a mandate provision. Protesters marched in support of Brooklyn Nets superstar Kyrie Irving ‚Äôs public opposition to the vaccine. The team has barred him from practice and playing until he gets vaccinated.

The sudden loss of amplified sound can be jarring, but when the crowd chimes in to close out song, like they did during this year‚Äôs Guns N‚Äô Roses set, bellowing together ‚ÄúOh, won‚Äôt you please take me ho-ome,‚Äù the inevitable viral video is marketing gold for the following year‚Äôs ticket sales. This year, the high-energy close may have served as a confidence booster for the hard rock band, which recently made its post-pandemic return to the road to play 25 shows postponed from its 2020 tour, as well as 14 new ones in nearby markets. The act‚Äôs last big series of concerts was the Not in this Lifetime tour, which made $500 million starting in spring 2016 and became the fourth-highest-grossing in history, according to Billboard Boxscore. Since the concert business started again, however, it is having a hard time getting fans to show up. On average, 10% of fans who bought tickets to see Guns N‚Äô Roses in 2019 and 2020 are coming to its shows, and performances planned for later this year in Mexico and Europe have been pushed back to 2022, amid worries about weak walkup sales. {""nid"":""9648655"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""Live Nation Stock Is Trading Over $100.

This fall, the Eagles, Billy Joel, George Strait, Zac Brown and James Taylor have seen no-show rates as high as 25% for some concerts. Industry executives blame persistent fears about the spread of COVID-19 in indoor venues, even among those who are vaccinated, as well as competition with a flood of other concerts, festivals and destination events. Even for shows that sold out already, that means fewer bodies in seats, as well as waker food, beverage and merchandise sales ‚Äì plus a blow to the ability to bookers and promoters to plan ahead. Festivals like BottleRock, which sold out ‚Äúin a matter of minutes‚Äù this year company officials say, are a bright spot in the post-pandemic music business, with the majority of such events increasing their attendance over 2019 levels, according to Live Nation‚Äôs most recent earnings report. One reason: Outdoor festivals are perceived to be safer than indoor shows. They also provide much better value. ‚ÄúFans can see so many more acts at a festival for the same price they would pay to attend a big headline tour,‚Äù says Bobby Dee, who‚Äôs producing the Once Upon a Time in LA festival in December, which features Snoop Dogg, The Game and Al Green and sold out in less than 24 hours. ‚ÄúThey are coming out the pandemic and making the decision that they don‚Äôt want to spend two hours watching one artist play their set and encore.

In most cases, traditional headline concerts pay artists a guaranteed minimum, after which ticket revenue is split with the promoter, which means both sides share risk. Festivals instead offer acts a flat payment, regardless of subsequent ticket sales. That‚Äôs appealing to booking agents, who are worried about exposing their clients to risks as the concert business re-opens. It also gives some festivals the chance to book once-in-a-lifetime headliners like Stevie Nicks, who was booked to perform at BottleRock. It can also mean paying huge fees to book headline talent that might not bring in the kind of ticket sales organizers hoped for. In the case of BottleRock, weeks before the event, Nicks announced she couldn‚Äôt perform because of ‚Äúrising COVID cases,‚Äù which left organizers to find a replacement big enough to placate customers and hopefully prevent refund requests that would put the festival in financial jeopardy. They secured Chris Stapleton, but he too pulled out the night before he was supposed to take the stage, blaming an unspecified illness. Brandi Carlile, who was already on the lineup, ended up filing in by flying in members of The Highwomen and singer Yola for a special set of their songs and covers. After all that, organizers say refund requests were minimal, speaking to the importance of the festival experience beyond headlining acts. But it shows how festivals may now need multiple backup plans. {""nid"":""9649430"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""How U.K. Touring Is Struggling to Keep On Truckin'"",""relative_path"":""\/articles\/business\/touring\/9649430\/uk-touring-struggling-post-brexit-rules\/"",""media"":{""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Market-global-bb15-2021-billboard-1548-1634755312-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Market-global-bb15-2021-billboard-1548-1634755312-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Market-global-bb15-2021-billboard-1548-1634755312-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9648240"",""caption"":null,""credit"":null}} ‚ÄúIf festivals continue to dominate in 2021, the major management companies might need to think about creating an on-call network of alternate acts that can step in at the last minute to high profile slots if something goes wrong,‚Äù said one agency source at the event. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to prepare for a music business that‚Äôs going to require more flexibility and contingencies.‚Äù ¬† {""account_id"":""1125911414"",""id"":""izFpZKac"",""title"":"""",""featured_media"":""""}",10/25/21 20:12,,https://static.billboard.com/files/2021/10/guns-n-roses-bb15-touring-market-billboard-1548-1634754994-150x150.jpg,billboard

Getty Images The Green Bay Packers placed wide receiver Davante Adams on the reserve/COVID-19 list Monday. Being placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list is for a player who either tests positive for COVID-19 or who has been in close contact with an infected person or persons. Adams ranks second in the NFL with 52 catches and is third in yards (744). Green Bay (6-1) travels to Arizona (7-0) Thursday for an NFC showdown, and playing without Adams would be an enormous blow to the Packers. Green Bay learned earlier on Monday that defensive coordinator Joe Barry had also tested positive for COVID-19 and will likely miss Thursday‚Äôs game in Arizona. ‚ÄúYou have to take it in stride and just approach it with positive mind and a positive attitude and just make the best of whatever situation you encounter,‚Äù Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. After a rocky start to his career, Adams ‚Äî a second round draft pick in 2014 ‚Äî has developed into one of the top receivers in football. Adams was named to the Pro Bowl each season from 2017-20 and he was named first-team All-Pro in 2020. Adams was the NFL‚Äôs No. 1 rated wide receiver by Pro Football Focus last season. Adams set a franchise record with 115 receptions and posted 1,374 receiving yards (11.9 avg.) a year ago despite missing two games. He also matched Sterling Sharpe‚Äôs single-season team record for receiving touchdowns (18) set in 1994.

He led the NFL in receiving TDs, receiving yards per game (98.1) and receptions per game (8.2), becoming the first NFL player to lead the league in all three categories since Sharpe did so in 1992. Adams earned first-team All-Pro honors from The Associated Press, the first Packers wide receiver to receive first-team recognition since Antonio Freeman in 1998. He also earned first-team All-NFL honors from the Pro Football Writers Association. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason he‚Äôs got that ‚Äò99‚Äô rating in Madden,‚Äù LaFleur said recently. ‚ÄúHe is a baller.

Bayern star Joshua Kimmich at center of COVID vaccine debate,https://www.nsnews.com/national-sports/bayern-star-joshua-kimmich-at-center-of-covid-vaccine-debate-4549570,,['Canadian Press'],,BERLIN (AP) ‚Äî Bayern Munich soccer star Joshua Kimmich has found himself at the center of a debate in Germany over the merits of vaccination against the coronavirus.,,10/25/21 20:16,"BERLIN (AP) ‚Äî Bayern Munich soccer star Joshua Kimmich has found himself at the center of a debate in Germany over the merits of vaccination against the coronavirus. The 26-year-old Kimmich, tipped as a future Germany captain for his leadership qualities, confirmed over the weekend that he is yet to be vaccinated against COVID-19 because of his own concerns about ‚Äúa lack of long-term studies‚Äù into the effects of the vaccines. Kimmich said he was still considering it and that it was ‚Äúvery possible that I will get vaccinated.‚Äù His comments were welcomed by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has consistently opposed measures against the coronavirus, while they led to dismay among those who are banking on vaccines as a route back toward normalcy at a time when infection rates are climbing again in Germany. ‚ÄúThe more people who are vaccinated, the less dangerous the virus will be,‚Äù Leipzig's American coach Jesse Marsch said Monday. Medical expert Alena Buyx, president of the German Ethics Council, said Kimmich is ‚Äúcaught up in misinformation. He is very badly advised. This is something that has now spread, and it would be great if he‚Äôd used his platform to get better advice to be a role model in this regard.‚Äù Buyx added: ‚ÄúIt is important to clarify that these forms of long-term effects do not exist.‚Äù German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday that there were ‚Äúclear and convincing answers‚Äù to Kimmich‚Äôs questions from national and international experts, and that he hoped that ‚ÄúKimmich lets all this information work on him and then maybe he can decide in favor of the vaccination.‚Äù Kimmich‚Äôs reluctance to get vaccinated surprised many due to his involvement in setting up the ‚ÄúWe Kick Corona‚Äù fundraising campaign with Bayern and Germany teammate Leon Goretzka in March 2020. Together they raised millions for social and charitable organizations to continue working during the pandemic, while some of that money also went to medical associations. ‚ÄúWe also donated to UNICEF, who made vaccines available. The point was that there are also countries that do not have access to vaccines,‚Äù Kimmich said Saturday after Bayern‚Äôs win over Hoffenheim. ‚ÄúI think everyone should make the decision for themselves and it cannot be that someone has no access. Because if you make the decision to do so, then you should do everything you can to ensure that they can get the vaccine."" The player denied being opposed to vaccines. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a shame about the debate, that it‚Äôs only about being vaccinated or not vaccinated and if you‚Äôre not, then you‚Äôre automatically a COVID-denier or vaccine-opponent,‚Äù Kimmich said. ‚ÄúBut there are other people at home, I think, who are simply having thoughts ‚Äî whatever the reasons are. I think they should be respected, especially if they are sticking to the guidelines.‚Äù Neither the German soccer league nor the clubs publicize which players are vaccinated and which are not. Several have contracted the coronavirus since the pandemic began. Kimmich is almost certainly not the only Bundesliga player who isn‚Äôt vaccinated, but his stature as a Bayern and Germany leader ‚Äî he captained Germany in Manuel Neuer‚Äôs absence recently ‚Äî means his statements carry added weight. ‚ÄúAs an example, but also for practical reasons, it would be better if he were vaccinated,‚Äù former Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. Rummenigge‚Äôs successor Oliver Kahn said that Bayern‚Äôs stance as a club is that ‚Äúwe can only recommend to everyone to get vaccinated‚Äù but that ‚Äúyou also have to respect if one or another has another opinion.‚Äù Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann is currently self-isolating at home after testing positive for COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated . Nagelsmann is coping well with the disease and has been conveying messages to assistant coach Dino Toppm√∂ller for the last two games. While most of last season was played without any fans at all present, this season has seen their return under stringent conditions. Most clubs are still operating under the so-called 3G rule ‚Äì spectators must be vaccinated against COVID-19, have recovered from the disease, or have proof of a negative test result. But some only allow vaccinated or recovered fans to attend games. The same rule doesn‚Äôt apply to players or it would mean that Kimmich, and any others who aren't vaccinated, would not be granted entry. Kimmich said he undergoes tests regularly, and that they are paid for by his club. Former Bayern president Uli Hoeness would not be drawn on his thoughts over Kimmich‚Äôs statements. ‚ÄúI have an opinion on the matter, but only for him,‚Äù Hoeness said. ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports ___ Ciar√°n Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP Ciar√°n Fahey, The Associated Press",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2021/10/20211025161012-6177107b3795706fd802a503jpeg.jpg;w=630,nsnews
Miami private school nixes 30-day quarantine for vaccinated students,https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/miami-school-nixes-30-day-quarantine-for-vaccinated-students/,,['Joshua Rhett Miller'],,"A private school in Miami has reversed course on its controversial plan to force students who got COVID-19 vaccines to quarantine for 30 days, a report said Monday.","A private school in Miami has reversed course on its controversial plan to force students who got COVID-19 vaccines to quarantine for 30 days, a report said Monday.",10/25/21 20:16,"A private school in Miami has reversed course on its controversial plan to force students who got COVID-19 vaccines to quarantine for 30 days, a report said Monday. The about-face by administrators at Centner Academy came after the state threatened to pull funding from the school if it went ahead with the plan, which was based on debunked claims that newly vaccinated people could shed the virus, WPLG reported . Centner‚Äôs chief operating officer, Bianca Erickson, assured the Florida Department of Education in a letter Friday that the school would not require any student to ‚Äúquarantine at home‚Äù if vaccinated. ‚ÄúWhen we announced the subject policy regarding COVID-19, we believed that we were acting in compliance with the Department of Education‚Äôs Emergency Rule ‚Ä¶ which allows a student to be considered in attendance at school when under a ‚Äòstay-home‚Äô directive related to COVID-19,‚Äù Erickson wrote. ‚ÄúOur plan at the time included a ‚Äòstay-home‚Äô policy that would be supported by remote learning,‚Äù Erickson‚Äôs letter continued. ‚ÄúPlease note, however, that the plan as announced was not implemented prior to receipt of your letter and we will not pursue any such measures.‚Äù State education officials had warned the school in a letter Thursday that the proposed policy would run afoul of the law and could lead to lost funding, WPLG reported. ‚ÄúRecently it has come to our attention that your schools may employ attendance policies which require parents of recently vaccinated students to quarantine their children for unreasonable, unnecessary and unduly burdensome amount of time before returning for in-person instruction,‚Äù the letter to the school read. The DOE warned that ‚Äúswift and decisive‚Äù punitive actions against the school could follow, including the revocation of funding. A Post message seeking comment from the school was not returned Monday. The private K-8 school for roughly 300 students ‚Äî where tuition costs up to $29,850 this year ‚Äî had informed parents earlier this month that vaccinated students would need to stay home for at least 30 days after each dose and booster they received and could only return afterward if ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù and symptom-free. Dr. Aileen Maria Marty, an infectious-disease expert at Florida International University, blasted the message as ‚Äúvery destructive,‚Äù WPLG had reported . ‚ÄúThat is not written by anyone who has any understanding of the science,‚Äù Marty told the station. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that simple, it‚Äôs pure fiction.‚Äù The school‚Äôs co-founder, David Centner, told WPLG in an email that the policy was designed to protect ‚Äústudents‚Äô well-being and their sense of safety‚Äù while at school and based partly on ‚Äúnumerous‚Äù anecdotal cases. ‚ÄúBig Pharma itself has created reasonable uncertainty as to whether their product may carry the risk of ‚Äòadverse events‚Äô via inhalation or skin contact to those who are unvaccinated,‚Äù Centner added in the email. But Pfizer, maker of the only vaccine currently approved by the FDA for people age 12 and older, flatly told WPLG that its shot doesn‚Äôt contain virus particles and therefore they cannot be transmitted to others. ‚ÄúBecause there is no virus produced in the body, no shedding occurs within the human body,‚Äù Pfizer said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe vaccine cannot be inhaled via shedding and can only enter the human body through an administered dose.‚Äù A statement on the school‚Äôs website regarding its vaccine policy notes that it values ‚Äúfreedom of choice‚Äù and religion. ‚ÄúWe are proud that our happiness school takes a comprehensive look at vaccine policies statewide, and we accept religious exemptions in lieu of proof of vaccination,‚Äù the website reads. Centner Academy also made national headlines in April when it asked its teachers to wait until the end of the school year to get vaccinated. If they did anyway, the educators were told they wouldn‚Äôt be able to return for the next academic year, CNN reported .",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Centner-Academy.jpg?quality=90&strip=all,nypost

(Nasdaq: CERT), a global leader in biosimulation, today announced that its Simcyp COVID-19 Vaccine Model has won an R&D 100 Award, which recognizes the top 100 ‚ÄúR&D pioneers and their revolutionary ideas in science and technology‚Äù in the past year. The model, which is incorporated in Certara‚Äôs Vaccine Simulator, has been used by major pharmaceutical companies and allows researchers to study how a vaccine is handled by the human body in computer-generated, virtual populations. ‚ÄúWe are proud and honored that the R&D 100 Awards judges recognized the important contributions being made by Certara‚Äôs biosimulation software during this pandemic,‚Äù said Piet van der Graaf, PharmD, PhD, senior vice president of Quantitative Systems Pharmacology at Certara. ‚ÄúOur COVID-19 Vaccine Model is being used to determine optimal vaccine doses and timing between doses, investigate differences in immune response with age and ethnicity, evaluate the duration of immune response after vaccination, and identify the best booster sequencing for COVID-19 vaccines. We are also now applying our Vaccine Simulator to develop vaccines for oncology and respiratory syncytial virus.‚Äù Certara‚Äôs Simcyp COVID-19 Vaccine Model has demonstrated that it can accurately predict the outcomes of actual clinical trials using COVID-19 vaccines. Its prediction that the optimal timing between the first two COVID-19 vaccine doses is eight weeks was validated by the Pitch study conducted at Oxford University.

No pressure. Trudeau will unveil his latest cabinet Tuesday morning after Canadians returned his Liberals to government with a minority mandate last month. It‚Äôs expected to be a larger cabinet than those Trudeau has worked with since becoming prime minister in 2015, and to maintain gender parity. Regional, linguistic and demographic considerations will also go into Trudeau‚Äôs cabinet making exercise. But aside from ticking boxes, Trudeau has several major policy files facing his government that will go a long way to determining his legacy as Canada‚Äôs 23 rd prime minister. Read more: PM Trudeau to unveil cabinet ministers in ceremony on Tuesday Story continues below advertisement COVID-19 and its economic fallout One cabinet position is not up for speculation: Chrystia Freeland will remain both deputy prime minister and the minister of finance. Freeland will be responsible for implementing the Liberals‚Äô economic agenda ‚Äî largely laid out in their pre-election budget ‚Äî and for tweaking the Liberals‚Äô supports for those workers still facing disruptions from the COVID crisis. There have been positive signs for the Liberals on that front ‚Äî Statistics Canada reported earlier this month that employment returned to its pre-pandemic levels in September, with the unemployment rate inching down 0.2 percentage points to 6.9 per cent. That‚Äôs the lowest unemployment rate Canada has seen since the onset of the pandemic. Much depends on how Canadian households will use the savings they amassed over the course of the pandemic, while public health measures restricted where and when they could spend disposable income. A recent report from CIBC Economics suggested that pent-up consumer spending could be a ‚Äúspringboard‚Äù for Canada‚Äôs economy over the next two years ‚Äî but noted that Canadians have been ‚Äúcautious‚Äù with their money compared to U.S. consumers, even in sectors not directly hit with pandemic shutdowns. For Freeland and the Liberals, the potential risk of persistent inflation is a more troubling economic ‚Äî and political ‚Äî issue. The consumer price index rose 4.4 per cent year-over-year in September , according to Statistics Canada ‚Äî the largest increase since 2003. That‚Äôs something Canadians feel directly at the gas pump, in grocery stores and restaurants. It‚Äôll be up to Freeland to reassure Canadians that the government has the finance file under control.

Trudeau has made the fight against climate change a central pillar of his government since coming to power in 2015, setting a price on carbon and ambitious new targets to curtail Canada‚Äôs emissions, including reaching net zero by 2050. But critics have pointed out that Canada‚Äôs emissions have risen between 2015 and 2019, the most recent year for which data is available. Trudeau is scheduled to attend COP26, the UN climate change conference, later this month. But whoever the prime minister entrusts with the climate change file will have to shoulder the heavy-lifting to finally make good on Canada‚Äôs ambitious targets ‚Äî even as some Liberal stalwarts express doubts about the government‚Äôs ability to meet them. 0:45 Canada‚Äôs climate change minister says the $100B COP26 climate finance goal will be ‚Äòoverachieved‚Äô Canada‚Äôs climate change minister says the $100B COP26 climate finance goal will be ‚Äòoverachieved‚Äô Read more: COP26: McKenna says she has doubts world will hit Paris climate targets Story continues below advertisement Military Misconduct Among the most pressing of the files on the government agenda is the Canadian Forces sexual misconduct crisis, which has only continued to escalate over the past nine months as allegation after allegation emerges against senior military leaders. Most recently, Adm. Art McDonald came under a firestorm of criticism after he sent a letter to senior military leaders arguing that he should be reinstated to the role as chief of the defence staff given that an investigation into an allegation of sexual assault against him did not yield charges. McDonald argued the lack of charges was an ‚Äúexoneration‚Äù of him and that the investigation deemed the allegation ‚Äúunsubstantiated.‚Äù That is not the case, however, and the military‚Äôs provost marshal issued a statement shortly afterwards explaining that the determination of a lack of evidence to support laying a charge was not the same thing as deeming an allegation to be ‚Äúunfounded.‚Äù Yet so far, Trudeau and current Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan have refused to say when they intend to make a decision on McDonald‚Äôs future. At the same time, the government has refused to provide a timeline for when they will act to implement one of the major demands of advocates for survivors and victims of military sexual misconduct ‚Äî an independent reporting system, operating outside the chain of command. Story continues below advertisement Will Sajjan ‚Äî or whomever Trudeau chooses to serve as defence minister ‚Äî act immediately on desperately needed reforms? Or will the military have to wait until another review ‚Äî this one conducted by retired Supreme Court Justice Louise Arbour ‚Äî lands early next year? Read more: TIMELINE: The Canadian Forces sexual misconduct crisis Reconciliation and First Nations One of the more pressing files for the new cabinet is a decision on whether they will appeal a Federal Court decision on providing services and compensation to First Nations children. The government has until Friday to make that decision, which will weigh on the shoulders of whichever MPs find themselves serving as Minister of Justice and Minister of Indigenous Services. There are two rulings at the heart of the decision the Liberals will have to make. The first is a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling from September 2019, which found the federal government ‚Äúwillfully and recklessly‚Äù discriminated against Indigenous children living on reserve through the underfunding of services. As a form of redress for this discrimination, the tribunal ordered Ottawa to pay $40,000 each to roughly 50,000 First Nations children and their relatives. The second ruling is from November 2020. It expanded the scope of Jordan‚Äôs Principle ‚Äî a rule that pledges to provide First Nations children with the services they need, when they need them, rather than first taking the time to sort out which level of government is responsible for the cost. Story continues below advertisement The Federal Court shot down the government‚Äôs most recent bid to appeal these decisions on September 29. Now the government has until Friday to decide if they‚Äôd like to continue to litigate the issue at the Federal Court of Appeal. The next step after that would be the Supreme Court of Canada.

The use of general anaesthetics has increased since the outset of the pandemic, as they are needed to support COVID-19 patients on ventilators in intensive care units. Aspen's factory in the southern city of Gqeberha has been turned into ""a crucial anaesthetics hub"" as ""one of the world's largest general anaesthetics production lines"", Aspen chief executive Stephen Saad said in a statement. The Durban-based company has invested more than three billion rand ($204 million) in the facility, making it the single largest investment in the pharmaceutical industry in South Africa -- which had until now relied on imported anaesthetics. While the bulk of production will be exported globally, the company will also guarantee local security of supply, said South African Trade Minister Ebrahim Patel, cited in the same statement. It was installed at the same facility where Aspen started producing Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines in July. The company handles the final stages of the jabs' manufacturing known as the ""fill and finish process"". Pharma giants BioNTech and Pfizer have since also clinched similar vaccine production deals with South Africa's Biovac. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS or Android device.",,ewn
iOS 15.1 Features: Everything New in iOS 15.1,https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-15-1-features/,"['Featured', 'iOS 15']",['Juli Clover'],,"Apple today released iOS 15.1, the first major update to the iOS 15 operating system that was released in September. iOS 15.1 introduces new features that were delayed from ‚ÄåiOS 15‚Äå plus it adds camera improvements for iPhone 13 Pro users. This guide highlights everything that's been added in the iOS 15.1 update. SharePlay Integrated into the FaceTime app, SharePlay is a feature that's designed to allow people to do more together virtually using ‚ÄåFaceTime‚Äå. There are built-in options for listening to music with others with playlist sharing and watching TV and movies with syncing. There's also a SharePlay screensharing component for sharing what's on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac with someone else, a feature great for group planning or assisting someone with device troubleshooting. SharePlay was meant to be introduced as part of the initial ‚ÄåiOS 15‚Äå update, but Apple had to delay it because it was buggy and not ready for release. ProRes Video Capture (iPhone 13 Pro) When the ‚ÄåiPhone 13 Pro‚Äå models launched, Apple promised that a high-quality ProRes video option would be coming in an update, and it has arrived in iOS 15.1. ProRes is a professional video recording format used by TV show, commercial, and movie creators, and the format offers higher color fidelity and less compression. ProRes support allows ‚ÄåiPhone 13 Pro‚Äå and Pro Max owners to capture, edit, and share professional-quality videos from their devices. You can enable ProRes by going to the Camera section of the Settings app and tapping on ""Formats."" From there, toggle on ""Apple ProRes."" ProRes video capture is limited to 30fps at 1080p on devices with only 128GB of storage, but higher capacity devices can record in 4K. Apple says that a one-minute 10-bit HDR ProRes video takes up 1.7GB of space when recorded in HD mode, or 6GB in 4K mode. Auto Macro Toggle (iPhone 13 Pro) For macro shots, the ‚ÄåiPhone 13 Pro‚Äå models switch over to the Ultra Wide lens when the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå's camera gets close to an object, which some people are not a fan of because it can be difficult to get a shot with the camera lenses swapping back and forth. The iOS 15.1 update adds a new toggle to turn off Auto Macro, and when disabled, the Camera app will not automatically switch over to the Ultra Wide camera for macro photos and videos. Auto Macro can be turned off in the Camera section of the Settings app by scrolling down and toggling off the ""Auto Macro"" option. Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos With Spatial Audio for HomePod Paired with the HomePod 15.1 software, iOS 15.1 brings Lossless quality and Dolby Atmos Spatial Audio to the ‚ÄåHomePod‚Äå and the HomePod mini. Lossless audio and Dolby Atmos can be enabled through the Home app. Open up Home Settings, tap on your profile, and then under Media, tap on Apple Music. From there, toggle on Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos. Vaccine Cards in the Wallet App ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå users who have added their COVID-19 vaccination records to the Health app on the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå can now use those records to generate a vaccination card in the Wallet app. The Apple Wallet vaccination card can be shown to businesses, venues, restaurants, and more that are requiring vaccines for entry. Any vaccination record available through the SMART Health Cards specification can be added to the Health app and transferred to Wallet. California, Louisiana, New York, Virginia, Hawaii, and some Maryland counties support Smart Health Cards, as do Walmart, Sam's Club, and CVS Health. So those in the specific supported states should be able to look up their information in state databases, but those who were vaccinated through companies like Walmart and CVS can also add their information to the Health and Wallet apps because it's the same system. Home App There are new automations triggers that can be created based on HomeKit-enabled sensors that detect humidity, air quality, or light level. Shortcuts Shortcuts includes new actions for overlaying text on images or GIFs, and there are new Siri games. iPhone 12 Battery Algorithms For iPhone 12 models, there are updated battery algorithms that will offer better estimates of battery capacity over time. iPad Live Text On the ‚ÄåiPad‚Äå, the update adds the above listed features and support for Live Text in the Camera app. With Live Text, the Camera can detect text, phone numbers, addresses, and more, with the feature available on iPads that have an A12 Bionic chip or later. Live Text was already available on the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå. Bug Fixes The update includes several bug fixes for issues with Photos storage, the Weather app, the Wallet app, Wi-Fi, and more. - ‚ÄåPhotos‚Äå app may incorrectly report storage is full when importing photos and videos - Weather app may not show current temperature for My Location, and may display colors of animated backgrounds incorrectly - Audio playing from an app may pause when locking the screen - Wallet may unexpectedly quit when using VoiceOver with multiple passes - Available Wi-Fi networks may not be detected Guide Feedback Know of an iOS 15.1 feature we left out or want to offer feedback on this guide?

T he national government and regional authorities brought forward their Covid-19 coordination meeting by three days and will decide on Tuesday how to counter the sudden surge of virus infections. Requirements for the use of masks and some other measures were only relaxed early this month, and the easing could be partly turned back. However, Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke said that drastic restrictions were still out of the question. ‚ÄúBars and restaurants will remain open. Kids must go to school - it‚Äôs important. But maybe we will be going back to more face masks,‚Äù he told VRT network.

3 states lead the U.S. in workers quitting jobs,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/quitting-job-great-resignation-georgia-kentucky-idaho/,,,,"Workers are joining the ""Great Resignation"" due to burnout, COVID-19 anxiety and a search for higher wages, experts say.",,10/25/21 21:37,"A record number of Americans are quitting their jobs across the U,S. , a trend some have dubbed the ""Great Resignation."" But the phenomenon is making an outsized impact in some regions: In Georgia, Kentucky and Idaho, more than 4% of workers voluntarily left their jobs in Augus ‚Äî the highest rates in the country. Perhaps not coincidentally, those three are among the states with the nation's lowest minimum wage ‚Äî the federally mandated rate of $7.25 an hour. States with more generous baseline wages tended to have a lower ""quits"" rate, or the percentage of workers who handed in their resignations, recent federal labor data show. By comparison, about 1.7% of workers in Washington, D.C., quit their jobs in August, marking the lowest quits rate among all states recorded in August, according to the data. The nation's capital also has one of the nation's highest minimum wages, at $15.20 an hour. Nationally, almost 3% of workers handed in their resignations in August ‚Äî a record ‚Äî the government reported earlier this month . The number of people quitting rose to 4.3 million, far outpacing the number of layoffs from employers, who cut 1.3 million jobs the same month. Several factors could be contributing to the elevated quits rate. On the positive side, it signals that the job market is strong for workers, offering incentives to switch jobs or to simply quit a miserable job in the belief that something better will come along quickly. But with only one month of data, it's unclear yet whether the state-level trends are driven by wages, the mix of industries within a state or other causes, experts said. ""A fair amount of the variation in quitting across the country is driven by the types of jobs that are disproportionately done in different parts of the country,"" said Nick Bunker, director of economic research at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""So it's hard to know how much of the variation is driven just by the variation in industry and how much is the difference in labor market conditions,"" he said. But, Bunker added, wages may play a part. States with lower quit rates may have ""more employment in lower turnover industries and a higher likelihood to have a higher minimum wage."" COVID-19 fears Americans are also still struggling with the pandemic and fears about COVID-19 infections: 4 of 10 people who quit their job were either working in leisure and hospitality industries, such as restaurants, or in retail locations. (The share of workers in hospitality jobs in Georgia, Kentucky and Idaho are roughly on par with the national rate.) At the same time, workers are facing higher costs for everything from groceries to housing because of rising inflation. Higher bills may be prompting some people to search for better-paying jobs. Others are quitting to start their own businesses, leading to a record number of entrepreneurs hanging out their shingles. Through September, Americans have filed a record 1.4 million applications to start new businesses that are, in turn, likely to hire employees, according to an analysis of Census data by the Economic Innovation Group (EIG). Among those entrepreneurs is Nick Folmar, who was furloughed by his janitorial company 13 months ago and decided to start Jet Stream Clean, his carpet-cleaning business along the Alabama-Georgia border. Since starting his own business, he said his salary has doubled. ""If I'm going to have something, I'm going to have to create it,"" Folmar told CBS Evening News . ""And I'm going to create it with the skills that I have and the passion for the work I like to do.""

NDP Leader Rachel Notley accused Premier Jason Kenney and his cabinet of negligently downplaying the fourth wave of COVID-19, then disappearing in the summer as cases soared, resulting in hundreds of deaths and pushing hospital capacity to the breaking point. ‚ÄúThe premier went on vacation. He left Alberta without leadership,‚Äù Notley said in question period Monday as she pointed across the aisle at Kenney and his cabinet. ‚ÄúWhere was your health minister? Your deputy premier? Your finance minister? A single solitary adult over there? Where were they?‚Äù Kenney responded that every jurisdiction has had COVID-19 hard times and the NDP‚Äôs criticism is not helpful to solving the crisis. ‚ÄúThey (the NDP) have always craved an Australian-style hard and brutal lockdown, the consequences of which would require turning this province into a virtual police state,‚Äù said Kenney. The premier has said he didn‚Äôt react with renewed rules to address the soaring summer case numbers until Sept. 3, because he didn‚Äôt believe a COVID-19-weary population would follow them. The numbers have been dropping slowly in recent weeks, but there are still 182 people infected with the virus receiving intensive care. The health system has had to double its normal amount of ICU beds, forcing the cancellation of thousands of non-urgent surgeries, and call in the military to handle the surge. Kenney said there will be a review eventually of how his government handled the COVID-19 pandemic. He rejected the NDP‚Äôs call for an all-party committee with subpoena powers to get to the bottom of what happened over the summer. Now is not the time to pull medical staff away from their duties, he said. The legislature is to sit for five of the next six weeks through to the beginning of December. There's to be a one-week break around Remembrance Day. Government house leader Jason Nixon said there will be 18 to 20 bills focused on creating jobs and diversifying the economy. ‚ÄúI will be putting forward a very robust legislative agenda inside the legislature. And we will be going very quickly around the clock ‚Äî morning, noon and night ‚Äî to be able to fulfil that agenda for Albertans,‚Äù Nixon said. Kenney introduced the first bill Monday to streamline how professional requirements are processed for those from out of province. ‚ÄúOccupations are regulated inconsistently across Canada, creating a patchwork of credential recognition that holds back skilled and certified workers,‚Äù Kenney told a news conference. The bill would affect more than 100 regulated professions, including nurses, accountants, real estate agents, firefighters, paramedics, engineers, insurance adjusters and horse jockeys. Professional bodies would have to make a decision on an application within a month of receiving it and establish timely appeals for those rejected. They would also have to make available online a breakdown of what documents are required to apply and the fees involved. Kenney said the legislation, coupled with low taxes, high oil prices and COVID-19 receding, would help Alberta‚Äôs bottom line rebound. ‚ÄúWe are moving, I believe, probably into a strong and sustained cycle of economic growth,‚Äù said Kenney. ‚Äú(But) we are hearing about labour shortages, not just in Alberta, but across the economy in North America, (so) this is going to become an emerging challenge.‚Äù Infrastructure Minister Prasad Panda introduced legislation to codify how capital projects are given a green light and a 20-year strategy for capital planning.

It was a big moment at a show that has long prioritized size. This year, the dance mega-festival‚Äôs expanded footprint hosted 150,000 fans per day at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway from Oct. 22-24. Throughout the weekend, a sea of totems, flags and signs added to the cacophony of sights and sounds that made up the scene at Las Vegas‚Äô biggest music event of the year. These fan-made elements were added to the drone shows and fireworks displays that set the night sky on fire each evening during the event. {""nid"":""9647734"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""EDC Las Vegas First Music Festival to Stream in Roblox Metaverse"",""relative_path"":""\/articles\/news\/dance\/9647734\/edc-las-vegas-first-music-festival-stream-roblox-metaverse\/"",""media"":{""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Roblox-EDC-press-Billboard-2021-1548-1634742820-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Roblox-EDC-press-Billboard-2021-1548-1634742820-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Roblox-EDC-press-Billboard-2021-1548-1634742820-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9647951"",""caption"":null,""credit"":null}} Indeed, after a 17-month hiatus due to the pandemic, EDC roared back into town with its thumping bass, groovy trance and many other varieties of dance and electronic music. The festival has come a long way since it first moved to the desert from Los Angeles in 2011 ‚Äî with classic moments like the 2012 evacuation of the festival due to a windstorm, or the Red Bull Sky Dive team floating into the fest, or when Bryan Cranston appeared during Above & Beyond‚Äôs 2015 set as his his infamous character Walter White ‚Äî commemorated throughout the weekend. Of course, many new memories were made as well. Here are 10 standout moments from the weekend. A Zenner EDC The theme for 2021 was kineticZEN, a great idea considering the kind of year many of us had in 2020. This theme played out in a big way at EDC‚Äôs always massive kineticFIELD stage, the reveal of which is a highlight of the event each year. For kineticZEN, the Insomniac owl on the stage was nestled in a lotus blossom guarded by two statuesque deities. The Marquee nightclub Sky Deck ‚Äî a partnership with the Strip‚Äôs Marquee nightclub that hosts many EDC VIPs ‚Äî riffed on the theme with a Balinese design and a grotto for photo opps. Meanwhile, a nightly drone show highlighted some of kineticFIELD‚Äôs stage designs from over the years. {""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Marc-Van-der-Aa-for-Insomniac-Events-1-billboard-1548-1635199514-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Marc-Van-der-Aa-for-Insomniac-Events-1-billboard-1548-1635199514-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Marc-Van-der-Aa-for-Insomniac-Events-1-billboard-1548-1635199514-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Marc-Van-der-Aa-for-Insomniac-Events-1-billboard-1548-1635199514-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Marc-Van-der-Aa-for-Insomniac-Events-1-billboard-1548-1635199514-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""size"":"""",""alignment"":""center"",""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9650809"",""caption"":""EDC Las Vegas 2021"",""credit"":""Marc Van der Aa*"",""altText"":"""",""title"":""Marc-Van-der-Aa-for-Insomniac-Events-1-billboard-1548-1635199514""} Big-Name Sponsors Were Back While major brands may have shied away in the early days of EDC, now everyone is competing for naming rights. Allegiant Travel ‚Äî the same company that bought the naming rights to Vegas‚Äô recently opened Allegiant Stadium ‚Äî had its name all over the the ‚ÄúRave Terminal.‚Äù Meanwhile cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase claimed the ‚ÄúPixel Forest‚Äù and Verizon had its own viewing decks. The Reign of Alison Wonderland In 2016, Alison Wonderland made history as one of the first two women to play a solo set on the EDC mainstage. (Anna Lunoe also played solo on this same stage in 2016.) Five years later, Alison Wonderland persisted as a major force at EDC with a set that was one of the weekend‚Äôs most talked about. Her Friday night performance on the Circuit Grounds stage was everything EDC is known for, with a writhing mass of humanity moving to the huge sounds while fireworks lit the sky above them. Wonderland‚Äôs visuals featured feature film style clips with fan commentary, and when the Australian producer‚Äôs mixer broke during the set, she fixed it herself and then kept right on playing. That night around 3 a.m., she also jumped on the Parliament art car for a house-only pop-up set. {""nid"":""8504238"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""Alison Wonderland on Breaking Through By Singing, Producing & Telling Her Stories"",""relative_path"":""\/articles\/news\/dance\/8504238\/alison-wonderland-billboard-cover-story-2019\/"",""media"":{""width"":""1500"",""height"":""845"",""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/media\/Alison-Wonderland-bb08-2019-feat-billboard-wnpdijhrt-1500-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/media\/Alison-Wonderland-bb08-2019-feat-billboard-wnpdijhrt-1500-compressed.jpg"",""width"":""1500"",""height"":""845""},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/media\/Alison-Wonderland-bb08-2019-feat-billboard-wnpdijhrt-1500-compressed.jpg"",""width"":""1500"",""height"":""845""}],""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9286353"",""caption"":null,""credit"":null}} Loads of Celebs In addition to the more than 200 DJs playing the show, EDC hosted a bevy of celebs, including Mike Tyson, who hung out with Insomniac Founder and CEO Pasquale Rotella. Pauly Shore showed up at the Marquee Sky Deck, as did Drew Carey, while Brody Jenner arrived by helicopter and played guest bartender, serving his hard seltzer line Mamitas. And only in Las Vegas: Tao Group, which owns Marquee, bused in 200 models to pass out Tao restaurant bento boxes to hungry ravers. October Weather While EDC hours are typically billed as ‚Äúdusk ‚Äôtil dawn,‚Äù that tagline was slightly less accurate this year, given the event‚Äôs postponement from May to October. This time, EDC‚Äôs standard hours ‚Äî 6 p.m.-6 a.m. ‚Äî meant that the event started just after sunset and that the sun didn‚Äôt fully rise until about an hour after the show ended each morning. The calendar shift also meant cooler temperatures, with the event‚Äôs typically warm May nights being traded for early morning temperatures that dipped into the high 50s. This fall weather meant that the typically scantily clad EDC crowd (think pasties, tutus and not a whole lot else) instead opted for faux fur coats and, in more DIY sartorial choices, emergency mylar thermal blankets worn as capes. {""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/03-EDC-Las-Vegas-2021-billboard-1548-1635199326-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/03-EDC-Las-Vegas-2021-billboard-1548-1635199326-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/03-EDC-Las-Vegas-2021-billboard-1548-1635199326-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/03-EDC-Las-Vegas-2021-billboard-1548-1635199326-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/03-EDC-Las-Vegas-2021-billboard-1548-1635199326-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""size"":"""",""alignment"":""center"",""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9650808"",""caption"":""EDC Las Vegas 2021"",""credit"":""Courtesy of Insomniac"",""altText"":""EDC Las Vegas 2021"",""title"":""03-EDC-Las-Vegas-2021-billboard-1548-1635199326""} EDC in the COVID Era With EDC having been postponed from May to October due to shifting protocols around the pandemic, safety was top of mind given the massive crowd. Attendees were advised to bring either a copy of their vaccination card, a digital vaccine record or negative test results, although one report from the general admission area noted that no one on the security staff asked to see any of this information upon entry. (A test result was, however, requested upon entering the VIP Skydeck area.) We also witnessed very little masking, perhaps an irony given that masks are a typical fashion staple at any given EDC. Ten Years of Ti√´sto Billed as the only artist to have played all 10 years of EDC Las Vegas, the dance scene veteran took the kineticFIELD stage on Saturday night to play hits including ‚ÄúSplit‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Business.‚Äù Camp EDC Rises Again ‚Äî With a Few Complaints Camp EDC is the festival‚Äôs camping area located in the parking lot of the Motor Speedway, and it‚Äôs grown in popularity since its 2018 debut, offering amenities like goat yoga, kandi making, a pool and daytime parties. Divided into tents and an RV area, there were some complaints over the weekend as this year tents were not outfitted with air conditioning units, as they have been in years past. Those that filed a complaint with Insomniac were notified that air conditioning wasn‚Äôt offered due to the fact that cooler October temperatures did not necessitate it. On Thursday, a broken water pipe also caused some issues at Camp EDC, although water services were restored before the end of the day. {""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/02-EDC-Las-Vegas-2021-billboard-1548-1635199318-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/02-EDC-Las-Vegas-2021-billboard-1548-1635199318-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/02-EDC-Las-Vegas-2021-billboard-1548-1635199318-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/02-EDC-Las-Vegas-2021-billboard-1548-1635199318-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/02-EDC-Las-Vegas-2021-billboard-1548-1635199318-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""size"":"""",""alignment"":""center"",""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9650807"",""caption"":""EDC Las Vegas 2021"",""credit"":""Courtesy of Insomniac"",""altText"":""EDC Las Vegas 2021"",""title"":""02-EDC-Las-Vegas-2021-billboard-1548-1635199318""} Surprises Galore This year, Lil Nas X appeared onstage with Diplo to perform ‚ÄúIndustry Baby,‚Äù ‚ÄúMontero‚Äù and ‚ÄúOld Town Road,‚Äù while The Kid LAROI popped up during DJ Snake‚Äôs set to do ‚ÄúStay.‚Äù Diplo in fact played three times over the weekend, including an unannounced set appearance on the Forest House art car.

Now the big search Company appear to be on the right track with their new 5G Pixel 6 and 6 Pro smartphones, which come with all-new Android 12. I‚Äôve been using the new Google 6 for a few days now, and the latest Google offering has a lot going for it, despite it being a budget device. The specs are okay, the only problem is it‚Äôs branded Google, who up until now has struggled to be taken seriously in he phone market. The Google 6 is very responsive and fast due in part to Google incorporating their first proprietary chipset called Google Tensor. It also appears to be processing images and interfacing with the image sensor quicker and faster than several other 5G smartphones we have tested. Because it is a budget device it only comes with 6.4 inches, 1080 x 2400 pixels (Full HD+), AMOLED display, which is okay but not as good as the more expensive 6.71 inches, 1440 x 3120 pixels (Quad HD+), AMOLED display. Google used 100% recycled aluminium for the body of the Pixel 6. It looks and feels good, and the sides have a matte finish. It also has IP68 rating for water and dust resistance. One thing I would like to see is the new Android 12 OS, which is running on the Pixel 6, running on a Samsung Galaxy Android device. I believe the new Google OS, is a massive improvement on previous Android operating systems, the combination of a brand-new OS and the Google Tensor processor is a big improvement for Google. While delivering significant functionality gains, the Pixel 6, UI is cleaner and easier to navigate though you do have to be patient as you work through new ways to access functions and operate apps than previous operating systems. While the new Google Pixel 6 is a real threat to the Samsung A series and mid to affordable premium smartphones from the likes of Nokia, TCL, Oppo and Motorola, it‚Äôs carrying a lot of baggage from the failure of previous Google smartphones that has to be overcome. Google is throwing hundreds of millions marketing this device, as they have done in the past. The big difference this time round is they‚Äôve finally got a device that lives up to expectations. My biggest gripe is a big thick bar across the back of the device. This ugly design houses cameras and sensor array, it‚Äôs odd intrusive and takes a lot of getting used to. It‚Äôs a design feature that grows on you over time, with the top half of the device well and truly raised up off a flat surface and my concern is whether it‚Äôs going to be durable for the long haul. Previous issues, like the Pixel 5‚Äôs screen gap, which didn‚Äôt become apparent until a few weeks after the device officially launched and started landing in the hands of consumers appear to be a thing of the past. The Pixel 6 is very comfortable in the hand and weighs just 207 grams. It comes with an option of 8 GB RAM, 128 GB ‚Äì 8 GB RAM, 256 GB of storage, which is ample for a device that is selling for around $999. The device has a a 4,612mAh battery, which performed really well and I suspect the new OS and a new processor combined is adding to the better battery performance. I got one and a half days out of this battery before having to recharge. Camera Wallabies shot from a distance, image not as sharp I would like. The Pixel 6 has dual 50 + 12 MP, f/1.9 + f/2.28 MP f/2.0 front camera. This is in comparison to the top-end Google 6 Pro that is selling for $1,299. Fern tree using Pixel 6 This device if you want to step up has a triple 50 + 48 + 12 MP, f/1.9 + f/3.5 + f/2.2 11.1 MP f/2.2 front camera array. I tested this camera in overcast conditions, and it performed well, as these pictures show. Even close-up pictures looked good. Image colours were extremely accurate vs the image being shot but it‚Äôs not as good as the Samsung Galaxy S21 camera which is selling for $1,099 at JB Hi-Fi. The device uses Samsung‚Äôs Exynos 5123 modem, which has been tuned to function with Google‚Äôs custom Tensor processor. This is an old modem that was also in the Samsung S20. I compared the Pixel 6 with the S20 and Motorola‚Äôs new Edge 20 Pro which is selling for $899 and there was no difference other than it‚Äôs an old model modem which happens to be not broken and still delivers 5G, however it could struggle in some environments. The Galaxy S21 is using Qualcomm‚Äôs X60 5G modem and this along with several other pricey components is the reason why you will pay more for this device. My biggest problem was the Telstra network. I tested this device in Nelson Bay on the NSW North Coast and the 5G reception was more 3G and at a struggle 4G. I do want to do a review of the Google 6 Pro, as spec wise as it appears on paper that this device could be a better deal, especially as smartphones have become a key part of daily life, especially in this COVID era, where constant tapping and QR coding is essential via a smartphone.",10/25/21 22:49,,,channelnews
Stocktake: Auto-enrolment delays hurt pensions outlook,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/personal-finance/stocktake-auto-enrolment-delays-hurt-pensions-outlook-1.4707814?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"Ireland‚Äôs pension system ranks 13th out of 43 countries in Mercer‚Äôs 2021 Global Pension Index, but this masks a poor performance in one key area: sustainability.

But the librarian is central: otherwise, it‚Äôs just a room full of books without anyone there to show the potential within these books, without anyone to encourage and engage the students.‚Äù In 2005, a three-year pilot project to provide libraries to 10 disadvantaged schools issued its report.

We lend chess sets, board games and, crucially, digital readers to students. Schools should not have to be begging for this: it should be a nailed-on, protected resource.‚Äù The closure of the library during Covid, and subsequent restrictions and limitations on access, has brought this home for McCormack. ‚ÄúA box of books is not the same as a librarian who is a friendly face for the students and a person they can get support from.

Kathleen Moran: ‚ÄúIt was disappointing to see there was nothing for school libraries in the recent budget. We‚Äôve been knocking on the door for so long.‚Äù Photograph: Damien Eagers ‚ÄúWe do whatever needs to be done. We help close the achievement gap. The formal education system does not suit everyone and school libraries can come at learning from a different way, a way that suits every learner. ‚ÄúI had hundreds of requests from non-Deis schools for access to our digital library service during Covid, as well as requests for access from over 100 Youthreach centres,‚Äù says Moran. ‚ÄúI have quotations from suppliers to expand our digital library access to all 750 second-level schools and we could set it up very quickly if the funding and administrative supports were provided. ‚ÄúThe set-up cost would be minimal and the main cost would be the purchase of additional ebooks, e-audiobooks and digital magazines ‚Äì all of which would then be available to students and staff in every school in the country.‚Äù No school library? Visit your local It‚Äôs a simple but radical idea in many ways: a dedicated building where people can get books, audiobooks, educational resources and use of computers ‚Äì all for free. In 2019, Ireland abolished library fines, another quietly radical move that has made this national resource more accessible to all. ‚ÄúIt was a barrier to accessing information,‚Äù says Stuart Hamilton, head of libraries development at the Local Government Management Association. ‚ÄúSomeone might get a fine in the early part of their library use and it deters them from going back. So now we trust them, and because people have such a positive relationship with their library, there‚Äôs a feeling of mutual trust and a social responsibility.‚Äù There are over seven million library visits per year, and the number of active members is growing. Unstaffed hours The ‚Äúopen library‚Äù initiative has seen more libraries stay open for a number of unstaffed hours so that they can be used by more people, and RB Digital ‚Äì available to any library user ‚Äì is a massive digital resource of free magazines including National Geographic, Rolling Stone, the Economist, the New Yorker and more. Digital services have expanded to allow users to borrow audio books. The library‚Äôs Right to Read programme involves four different events for children throughout the year, all aimed at increasing literacy and developing a love of reading. ‚ÄúThe buildings had to close during Covid, but we made it easier for people to join online,‚Äù says Hamilton. ‚ÄúWe ran book clubs, coding events and children‚Äôs story time through Zoom, and discovered new audiences. We did home delivery services for some users and worked with Age Action to get older people online. We worked hard to maintain our connection with our users and are so glad to be opening up again.‚Äù See LibrariesIreland.ie for more information",,10/25/21 23:00,"Trinity Comprehensive School in Ballymun has a striking design.

At the same time, the demand for their services increased dramatically during Covid. ‚ÄúOur libraries were emptied of devices during Covid: we loaned them so young people could stay engaged,‚Äù says Moran. ‚ÄúWe do whatever needs to be done. We help close the achievement gap. The formal education system does not suit everyone and school libraries can come at learning from a different way, a way that suits every learner. ‚ÄúI had hundreds of requests from non-Deis schools for access to our digital library service during Covid, as well as requests for access from over 100 Youthreach centres,‚Äù says Moran. ‚ÄúI have quotations from suppliers to expand our digital library access to all 750 second-level schools and we could set it up very quickly if the funding and administrative supports were provided. ‚ÄúThe set-up cost would be minimal and the main cost would be the purchase of additional ebooks, e-audiobooks and digital magazines ‚Äì all of which would then be available to students and staff in every school in the country.‚Äù No school library? Visit your local It‚Äôs a simple but radical idea in many ways: a dedicated building where people can get books, audiobooks, educational resources and use of computers ‚Äì all for free. In 2019, Ireland abolished library fines, another quietly radical move that has made this national resource more accessible to all. ‚ÄúIt was a barrier to accessing information,‚Äù says Stuart Hamilton , head of libraries development at the Local Government Management Association . ‚ÄúSomeone might get a fine in the early part of their library use and it deters them from going back. So now we trust them, and because people have such a positive relationship with their library, there‚Äôs a feeling of mutual trust and a social responsibility.‚Äù There are over seven million library visits per year, and the number of active members is growing. The ‚Äúopen library‚Äù initiative has seen more libraries stay open for a number of unstaffed hours so that they can be used by more people, and RB Digital ‚Äì available to any library user ‚Äì is a massive digital resource of free magazines including National Geographic, Rolling Stone, the Economist, the New Yorker and more. Digital services have expanded to allow users to borrow audio books. The library‚Äôs Right to Read programme involves four different events for children throughout the year, all aimed at increasing literacy and developing a love of reading. ‚ÄúThe buildings had to close during Covid, but we made it easier for people to join online,‚Äù says Hamilton. ‚ÄúWe ran book clubs, coding events and children‚Äôs story time through Zoom, and discovered new audiences. We did home delivery services for some users and worked with Age Action to get older people online. We worked hard to maintain our connection with our users and are so glad to be opening up again.‚Äù See LibrariesIreland.ie for more information",https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4702821.1634479793!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg,irishtimes

Over the weekend, news surfaced about NIAID's funding of lab experiments on beagles in which their vocal cords were reportedly removed before their heads were exposed to biting flies which injected them with parasites. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaks during a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing at the Dirksen Senate Office Building in Washington, D.C., U.S., July 20, 2021. Stefani Reynolds/Pool via REUTERS TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY That taxpayer-funded experiment, first uncovered by the White Coat Waste Project in July, was executed in Tunisia, Sexton said on "" The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show "". Justin Goodman, a WCW Project vice president, told Fox News in August that the testing was likely a case of ""not following the science"", adding that the FDA reportedly has said testing on canines isn't always compatible to human-drug interactions. Sexton said the beagle experiments appear to transcend the politically-charged atmosphere around COVID-19 policy and mandates and have instead received criticism from people on all sides the political spectrum. FAUCI UNDER FIRE OVER REPORT ALLEGING NIAID SPENT $400K ON RESEARCH INFECTING DOGS WITH PARASITES ""This connection may just be too much to bear,"" he said, noting that members of Congress a letter demanding answers from Fauci on the nearly $376,000 grant. The letter was signed by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, including Democratic Reps. Ted Lieu, Calif., and Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C., to Republicans Reps. Fred Keller, Pa., and Nicole Malliotakis, N.Y. Sexton and co-host Clay Travis discussed how Fauci may not have had first-hand knowledge of the experiment but that the ""buck stops with [him]"" on grant being awarded from his agency. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, listens during a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee confirmation hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, July 20, 2021.

Hochul‚Äôs Health Dept. continues Cuomo-era stall in in releasing nursing-home COVID info,https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/hochuls-health-dept-continues-stalling-release-of-nursing-home-covid-info/,,['Bill Hammond'],,"Despite Gov. Kathy Hochul‚Äôs promises of transparency, the state Health Department continues responding to requests for pandemic data with stalling tactics","Despite Gov. Kathy Hochul‚Äôs promises of transparency, the state Health Department continues responding to requests for pandemic data with stalling tactics",10/25/21 23:47,"Despite Gov. Kathy Hochul‚Äôs promises of transparency , the state Health Department continues responding to requests for pandemic data with stalling tactics that became notorious during the Cuomo administration . In one striking example, the department recently responded to the Empire Center‚Äôs request for updated nursing-home fatality data with the same form letter ‚Äî and the same invalid excuse for delay ‚Äî that it used last year as part of what came to be recognized as a coverup. In its letter of Sept. 22, 2021 , the department said it couldn‚Äôt produce the data until Nov. 29 ‚Äî five months after the original request ‚Äî ‚Äúbecause a diligent search for responsive records is still being conducted.‚Äù That‚Äôs exactly the same boilerplate explanation that it gave for withholding nursing-home data from the Empire Center in August 2020 , and the claim was specious in both cases. In reality, the requested records were readily findable in the department‚Äôs Health Emergency Response Data System, or HERDS, which has been collecting daily reports from nursing homes since early in the pandemic. The unwarranted delay on nursing-home data is part of a pattern in how the department handles requests under the Freedom of Information Law. Of the 62 requests for pandemic data filed four months ago by the Empire Center, the department has completely fulfilled nine, four partly fulfilled and denied nine outright. It has postponed the other 40, including the request for nursing-home death data, indefinitely. In all but a few of those cases, it claims to be conducting a ‚Äúdiligent search‚Äù for records. Last week, the Empire Center formally appealed 32 of those postponements on grounds that the delays were unreasonable and that the department failed to commit to a hard deadline as required by law. In its appeals related to long-term care deaths, the center also cited the outcome of its lawsuit last year ‚Äì which resulted in a court ruling that the department had violated FOIL and an order to promptly turn over the requested data. The department has 10 business days to respond to the appeals. In case it needs to be said, last year‚Äôs stonewalling did not end well. The Cuomo administration was eventually forced to admit that the full toll among long-term care residents ‚Äî including those who died after being transferred to hospitals ‚Äî was almost 6,000 higher than previously known , an increase of about 50 percent. The ensuing scandal made national headlines and contributed to the political demise of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who resigned in August. Once the Empire Center obtained detailed records ‚Äî including the dates and locations of deaths ‚Äî it found a statistical correlation between a Cuomo administration policy directing homes to admit COVID-positive patients during the first wave and higher death rates in facilities that complied. Last Tuesday, Hochul unveiled a reorganized and upgraded COVID tracker Web site that she described as ‚Äúyet another step we are taking towards more transparency.‚Äù Among other positive steps, the state is posting more data in tabular, downloadable format. One of newly posted data sets gives the death tolls in nursing homes, assisted-living and other adult-care facilities, which is an improvement over the PDF files the state had posted before. But the data set gives only cumulative totals as of Oct. 18, 2021 ‚Äî without the date-specific information that would make it possible to track trends, pinpoint outbreaks or assess policy decisions. Meanwhile, the Health Department under Hochul‚Äôs management is withholding those important details in exactly the same discredited manner as it did under her scandal-scarred predecessor. If Hochul wants her administration to be truly transparent , she has a long way yet to go. Bill Hammond is senior fellow for health policy at the Empire Center.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/51584946181_NY-Gov-Kathy-Hochul-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all,nypost

Supporting your child‚Äôs education choice,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/supporting-your-child-s-education-choice-1.4701445?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"Open days are no longer just for students: they‚Äôre also a chance for parents or guardians to find out more about where their child might be going to third level. Over the past 18 months, these events have largely, if not exclusively, taken place online, opening up even more opportunities for parents to get involved. ‚ÄúThe increased availability of digital content by all higher education institutions over the last 18 months, in response to the Covid-19 restrictions, means it has never been easier for parents to quickly and efficiently access the relevant information they need to support their son or daughter‚Äôs CAO application,‚Äù says Sarah Geraghty, director of student recruitment and outreach at NUI Galway. ‚ÄúThe virtual experience cannot match the sense of possibility that a student gets from visiting a campus in person, however the online open days do have their benefits, and particularly so for parents.‚Äù Of course, it‚Äôs parents and guardians who will be stumping up the cost of overpriced student accommodation and the highest college fees in the European Union, and they want the best for their child, so it‚Äôs no surprise that they‚Äôd attend these events. But, that said, it is students who will be attending the college and course, so they need to take the lead. Ground rules So, what can a parent learn at college open day and what should they look out for? How can they best support their child and not take over the process? And should there be ground rules to avoid any potential conflict? John McGinnity is the admissions officer and assistant registrar at Maynooth University. ‚ÄúEvery student is unique and so, while some will want their parents sitting further away from them in a lecture theatre, others might be comfortable sitting beside them,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúOthers may just want their parents or guardians to drive them to and from the event and pay for lunch. There‚Äôs a part in the middle where parents and students will go their own ways.‚Äù For some teenagers, there is nobody more embarrassing in their parents, although that surly teenager can be a stereotyped clich√©. But, again, everyone will have different feelings. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd encourage parents or guardians to be alert to what works for their child,‚Äù says McGinnity. ‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre at, say, the psychology stand and the parent is asking all the questions, the student is missing out on a learning opportunity.‚Äù McGinnity advises parents to keep in mind that a lot has changed since they may have been in college themselves. ‚ÄúToday, there are many different pathways to particular careers, and while it might feel like there is only one course in one college to get to a particular career, bear in mind that students can follow broad interests in their undergraduate course and then do a more focused postgraduate. There are great pathways between level six/seven courses and level eight, while the pathways between further and higher education are becoming ever-more accessible.‚Äù Realistically, students can get a better sense of the campus environment when they are physically there, although Covid restrictions mean that this isn‚Äôt always possible. ‚ÄúIf there is one thing that a parent can do it is to be the resource that takes them to the various campuses, if possible,‚Äù says McGinnity. ‚ÄúThere can often be a moment when a student is walking around the campus and they know it is where they want to be.‚Äù Speaking very broadly and generally, research shows that girls may have put a little more thought into their college course choice, having been reflecting on it since transition year. Boys, however, can be a little more inclined to wait until sixth year and leave things until the last minute. ‚ÄúThe decision around the right course, college or pathway is not a moment in time, it is a process over a period of time where a student comes to understand their own innate skills, talents and interests,‚Äù says McGinnity. ‚ÄúIf you do it over two or three years it‚Äôs more of a marathon than a sprint because they‚Äôve had more time to reflect on it.‚Äù The ongoing failure to provide adequate and affordable accommodation for students and the high cost of college can lead to some difficult conversations. For a student who is keen to move away from home for college ‚Äì whether because they‚Äôre itching for independence or because there is a particular course they have in mind ‚Äì practical, financial considerations may put a halt to their ambitions. ‚ÄúIt should, in the first instance, be a student‚Äôs decision as to where to apply for college,‚Äù says McGinnity. ‚ÄúThere is a likelihood of students on the east coast going to a university on the east coast, within a commutable distance, and the recent budget has changed the adjacent rate for the SUSI grant from 45km to 30km (which means that students living closer to their college will be entitled to a higher grant). It is likely that there will still be a scarcity of accommodation in 2022.‚Äù Events for parents: What‚Äôs happening? A small selection of some parent events: * On Friday, November 19th, between 5-6pm, Dublin City University is hosting an online event for parents looking at how they should approach their son‚Äôs or daughter‚Äôs path to third-level education. Topics include the costs involved in attending college, supports available to students, what parents and guardians should look out for any issues that may arise. * UCC‚Äôs Open Day platform has a special booth for parents and guardians, packed with useful material. See ucc.ie/openday for more details. UCC will also be hosting live CAO Q&A sessions on January 19th and May 4th, 2022, and parents and guardians are welcome to attend. UCC has also created a free online course, Nurturing Bright Futures where young adults can reflect on their personality, likes, dislikes and educational preferences. Parents and guardians can help them work through this. The university has created a special parent/guardian booklet, where they have outlined sections in which they can help the young person in their life by checking in on their progress. For a hard copy, email graduateattributes@ucc.ie or download the digital version at ucc.ie/nurturingbrightfutures. * NUI Galway‚Äôs undergraduate open day took place on October 2nd, with more than 90 virtual exhibition booths and 75 talks and presentations, says Sarah Geraghty of NUI Galway. ‚ÄúMany of these talks and presentations will be available on demand on the NUI Galway website, affording parents, who are not always available to attend multiple open days due to busy work and family commitments, the opportunity to watch back talks in their own time.‚Äù These talks include information on where an NUI Galway degree will take you, student life at NUI Galway and preparing for college in 2022. Emer Neville: ‚ÄòIt has to be the student‚Äôs decision as to what they study, and it‚Äôs important that they do something they want to do, otherwise there‚Äôs a chance they will drop out.‚Äô My experience: Emer Neville, president of the Irish Second-Level Students‚Äô Union ‚ÄúI went to open days during transition year, when I really began to think of college. Some of these were online and some involved campus visits. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from Clonmel in Tipperary and, early on, I knew I could not go to Dublin because of the high cost of rent, so I looked at Galway and Cork. ‚ÄúI was 16 when I went to the open days at UCC, CIT (now Munster Technological Union), NUI Galway and GMIT. The whole family went to these open days, including my twin brother and my sister, who was in sixth year at the time. ‚ÄúMost of my peers had their parents with them, unless they‚Äôd gone to the open day with the school. My parents were there in the background to see the campus, where we might be living and what the facilities were like, but I took the lead when it came to looking into the course details. ‚ÄúIt has to be the student‚Äôs decision as to what they study, and it‚Äôs important that they do something they want to do, otherwise there‚Äôs a chance they will drop out. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also important to have a look at the city or town that the college is in, not just the campus. UCC is very close to the city centre, which makes it very walkable; UL is further out from the city centre but has lots of facilities on campus. ‚ÄúWhile it‚Äôs fine to bring the parents, students should take ownership of their education, because by the time they get to college they‚Äôll be an adult and expected to do things without their parents.‚Äù",,10/26/21 0:00,"Open days are no longer just for students: they‚Äôre also a chance for parents or guardians to find out more about where their child might be going to third level. Over the past 18 months, these events have largely, if not exclusively, taken place online, opening up even more opportunities for parents to get involved. ‚ÄúThe increased availability of digital content by all higher education institutions over the last 18 months, in response to the Covid-19 restrictions, means it has never been easier for parents to quickly and efficiently access the relevant information they need to support their son or daughter‚Äôs CAO application,‚Äù says Sarah Geraghty , director of student recruitment and outreach at NUI Galway . ‚ÄúThe virtual experience cannot match the sense of possibility that a student gets from visiting a campus in person, however the online open days do have their benefits, and particularly so for parents.‚Äù Of course, it‚Äôs parents and guardians who will be stumping up the cost of overpriced student accommodation and the highest college fees in the European Union, and they want the best for their child, so it‚Äôs no surprise that they‚Äôd attend these events. But, that said, it is students who will be attending the college and course, so they need to take the lead. So, what can a parent learn at college open day and what should they look out for? How can they best support their child and not take over the process? And should there be ground rules to avoid any potential conflict? John McGinnity is the admissions officer and assistant registrar at Maynooth University . ‚ÄúEvery student is unique and so, while some will want their parents sitting further away from them in a lecture theatre, others might be comfortable sitting beside them,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúOthers may just want their parents or guardians to drive them to and from the event and pay for lunch. There‚Äôs a part in the middle where parents and students will go their own ways.‚Äù For some teenagers, there is nobody more embarrassing in their parents, although that surly teenager can be a stereotyped clich√©. But, again, everyone will have different feelings. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd encourage parents or guardians to be alert to what works for their child,‚Äù says McGinnity. ‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre at, say, the psychology stand and the parent is asking all the questions, the student is missing out on a learning opportunity.‚Äù McGinnity advises parents to keep in mind that a lot has changed since they may have been in college themselves. ‚ÄúToday, there are many different pathways to particular careers, and while it might feel like there is only one course in one college to get to a particular career, bear in mind that students can follow broad interests in their undergraduate course and then do a more focused postgraduate. There are great pathways between level six/seven courses and level eight, while the pathways between further and higher education are becoming ever-more accessible.‚Äù Realistically, students can get a better sense of the campus environment when they are physically there, although Covid restrictions mean that this isn‚Äôt always possible. ‚ÄúIf there is one thing that a parent can do it is to be the resource that takes them to the various campuses, if possible,‚Äù says McGinnity. ‚ÄúThere can often be a moment when a student is walking around the campus and they know it is where they want to be.‚Äù Speaking very broadly and generally, research shows that girls may have put a little more thought into their college course choice, having been reflecting on it since transition year. Boys, however, can be a little more inclined to wait until sixth year and leave things until the last minute. ‚ÄúThe decision around the right course, college or pathway is not a moment in time, it is a process over a period of time where a student comes to understand their own innate skills, talents and interests,‚Äù says McGinnity. ‚ÄúIf you do it over two or three years it‚Äôs more of a marathon than a sprint because they‚Äôve had more time to reflect on it.‚Äù The ongoing failure to provide adequate and affordable accommodation for students and the high cost of college can lead to some difficult conversations. For a student who is keen to move away from home for college ‚Äì whether because they‚Äôre itching for independence or because there is a particular course they have in mind ‚Äì practical, financial considerations may put a halt to their ambitions. ‚ÄúIt should, in the first instance, be a student‚Äôs decision as to where to apply for college,‚Äù says McGinnity. ‚ÄúThere is a likelihood of students on the east coast going to a university on the east coast, within a commutable distance, and the recent budget has changed the adjacent rate for the SUSI grant from 45km to 30km (which means that students living closer to their college will be entitled to a higher grant). It is likely that there will still be a scarcity of accommodation in 2022.‚Äù Events for parents: What‚Äôs happening? A small selection of some parent events: * On Friday, November 19th, between 5-6pm, Dublin City University is hosting an online event for parents looking at how they should approach their son‚Äôs or daughter‚Äôs path to third-level education. Topics include the costs involved in attending college, supports available to students, what parents and guardians should look out for any issues that may arise. * UCC‚Äôs Open Day platform has a special booth for parents and guardians, packed with useful material. See ucc.ie/openday for more details. UCC will also be hosting live CAO Q&A sessions on January 19th and May 4th, 2022, and parents and guardians are welcome to attend. UCC has also created a free online course, Nurturing Bright Futures where young adults can reflect on their personality, likes, dislikes and educational preferences. Parents and guardians can help them work through this. The university has created a special parent/guardian booklet, where they have outlined sections in which they can help the young person in their life by checking in on their progress. For a hard copy, email graduateattributes@ucc.ie or download the digital version at ucc.ie/nurturingbrightfutures. * NUI Galway‚Äôs undergraduate open day took place on October 2nd, with more than 90 virtual exhibition booths and 75 talks and presentations, says Sarah Geraghty of NUI Galway. ‚ÄúMany of these talks and presentations will be available on demand on the NUI Galway website, affording parents, who are not always available to attend multiple open days due to busy work and family commitments, the opportunity to watch back talks in their own time.‚Äù These talks include information on where an NUI Galway degree will take you, student life at NUI Galway and preparing for college in 2022. My experience: Emer Neville , president of the Irish Second-Level Students‚Äô Union ‚ÄúI went to open days during transition year, when I really began to think of college. Some of these were online and some involved campus visits. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from Clonmel in Tipperary and, early on, I knew I could not go to Dublin because of the high cost of rent, so I looked at Galway and Cork. ‚ÄúI was 16 when I went to the open days at UCC, CIT (now Munster Technological Union), NUI Galway and GMIT. The whole family went to these open days, including my twin brother and my sister, who was in sixth year at the time. ‚ÄúMost of my peers had their parents with them, unless they‚Äôd gone to the open day with the school. My parents were there in the background to see the campus, where we might be living and what the facilities were like, but I took the lead when it came to looking into the course details. ‚ÄúIt has to be the student‚Äôs decision as to what they study, and it‚Äôs important that they do something they want to do, otherwise there‚Äôs a chance they will drop out. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also important to have a look at the city or town that the college is in, not just the campus.

Choosing a course: What interests you the most?,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/choosing-a-course-what-interests-you-the-most-1.4702837?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"After Christmas ‚Äì and particularly coming into April ‚Äì the demands of the Leaving Cert have a sneaky habit of creeping up on you, leaving you with a little less time for considering courses and career options. So, it makes sense to use your time wisely: open days are a good opportunity to find out as much as you possibly can about the courses that interest you. But how should you go about it? Once you‚Äôve identified the courses that catch your eye, open days are usually structured to allow you to talk to tutors, lecturers and, ideally, other students on the course. Here‚Äôs some of the questions you should ask yourself ‚Äì and them. 1 What do you like? ‚ÄúI start by sitting down with my students, asking them to look at the subjects they‚Äôre currently doing and what they enjoy the most,‚Äù says Betty McLaughlin, a former president of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors and a guidance counsellor in Mullingar, Co Westmeath. ‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre doing six subjects and can pick two that they like, it can give them a steer as to what areas they may be interested in or have the aptitude for.‚Äù Of course, the subjects that students are taking in school may not directly correspond with a college course: there‚Äôs no sociology or psychology on the Leaving Cert curriculum, for instance, and while engineering is available as a Leaving Cert subject, a majority of students don‚Äôt sit the subject. ‚ÄúTake engineering or science as an example,‚Äù says McLaughlin. ‚ÄúYou need to be a problem-solver, analytical and mathematical. If you‚Äôre doing honours maths and you‚Äôre good at it ‚Äì perhaps alongside physics or chemistry ‚Äì it could indicate that engineering or science is a good fit for you.‚Äù 2 What have you done? In March 2020, schools closed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and this meant that students may have missed out on any work experience scheduled from mid-March onwards. That said, quite a few may have done work experience in the preceding months, and it may have given them an indication of what they are ‚Äì and are not ‚Äì interested in. 3 What might fit you? Psychometric interest tests are not the be-all and end-all, but they can give you a useful steer towards the areas that interest you. ‚ÄúThere are useful psychometric interest tests available on Qualifax.ie,‚Äù says McLaughlin. ‚ÄúIt can help you to understand if you‚Äôre geared more towards practical areas or whether you might prefer to work with people.‚Äù You‚Äôre not locked into the results of any of these tests: if the results absolutely jar with your instincts and gut feeling, they don‚Äôt have to be a deciding factor. 4 What if you‚Äôre not sure? A lucky few will already know the courses and career areas of most interest to them, but many won‚Äôt have a clue. This is where broad, general entry courses in areas such as arts, business, engineering or science can be useful, particularly if you‚Äôve already identified the general area of study that might interest you. And, luckily, many third-levels offer broad, general entry routes to these areas, where students can sample a range of different subjects before deciding what to specialise in down the line. ‚ÄúI often try to gear students towards these general entry courses,‚Äù says McLaughlin. ‚ÄúThey can get a broad taste of each module by the end of first or second year and it makes them better informed about what really interests them. But, that said, there are also specialised courses ‚Äì such as politics with philosophy and economics, or genetics, or chemical engineering ‚Äì that they can enter from first year, and some students will be sure from the outset that this is the right call for them.‚Äù 5 What are the modules like? This may be the single most important question a prospective student can ask themselves. Because, sure, the subject as a whole might seem interesting from a distance, but it‚Äôs only when you get up close and look at exactly what you‚Äôll be studying that you can get a real feel for whether you‚Äôd enjoy it. A module is a self-contained unit of study within a programme. University College Dublin‚Äôs history programme, for instance, includes modules on Nazi Germany, Islam and Christianity in the middle ages, or as in UCD‚Äôs history course, Living Loving and Dying in 19th Century Ireland. At University of Limerick, the common entry biological and biological sciences course includes, in year one, modules on general chemistry, laboratory calculations and biology for biosciences, among others. ‚ÄúGo through the modules, be aware of what you will be studying and ask: will this excite me?‚Äù McLaughlin suggests. ‚ÄúWill I be sure I can do well in this course? Will it fulfil me?‚Äù 6 What commitment does it require? It‚Äôs a good idea to find out how many hours of ‚Äúcontact time‚Äù ‚Äì the hours you‚Äôll spend in lectures and tutorials ‚Äì as well as the suggested amount of time you will have to study and work on assignments. ‚ÄúThis is because you want to know how much is required of you and whether it will leave time for you to get involved in other aspects of college life, such as clubs and societies,‚Äù says McLaughlin. 7 Will I get the points and meet minimum requirements? ‚ÄúI always do a points forecast to help students get a sense of how they might do on their best day over their six best subjects,‚Äù says McLaughlin. ‚ÄúA lot of the students have a fair idea of what they are capable of, and [school exams and mocks] can help them. The CAO Change of Mind system is available until July 1st. You do need to be realistic about what you will get, and while your dream college might be, say, UCD, you might also be able to do the course in another college with fewer points.‚Äù While students have traditionally been able to get a rough idea of what points for any given course might be like, based on points in previous years, the huge surge in CAO points over the past two years ‚Äì caused by grade inflation ‚Äì make it difficult to know what points will be like in 2022. McLaughlin, however, says that there likely won‚Äôt be accredited grades in 2022 and that it is possible that the points in 2019 may be a better guide to possible CAO points next year. But nobody can be fully sure. 8 Is there work experience? A growing number of colleges and courses offer a semester or a year of paid work experience to students ‚Äì experience which can be very helpful upon graduation. ‚ÄúThis can also help the student to get into a company when they finish up,‚Äù says McLaughlin. ‚ÄúThere may also be opportunities to study or work abroad. It‚Äôs definitely worth inquiring about this in relation to the courses that interest you.‚Äù 9 Why this college? While the course details should be critical to a student‚Äôs decision, don‚Äôt neglect whether the college ‚Äì and town or city that it‚Äôs in ‚Äì is the right place for you. Affordable student accommodation is in short supply and the Union of Students in Ireland, as well as individual lecturers and local students‚Äô unions, have been highlighting stories of students commuting for four hours or more each day. For many students, the cost of living away from home is prohibitive and this means that they might want to look, if possible, at courses within a reasonable commutable distance. 10 Why this course? ‚ÄúSome courses are more or less the same wherever you do them,‚Äù McLaughlin says. ‚ÄúNursing is monitored by [the regulatory body] the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland while the Teaching Council sets down what teachers need to know. This means that modules will be broadly similar. With this in mind, the differences may be around work experience or studying abroad.‚Äù It could also mean that, for some students and their families who are considering the family finances, it makes sense to study in a more local college. 11 What other entry routes exist? Go beyond the level-eight courses. Look at what‚Äôs available in level-seven courses and whether you can move from that level seven into a level eight. Post Leaving Cert (PLC) courses can also provide progression pathways into third-level. 12 Where will it take me? Although employers will increasingly take graduates from any discipline, McLaughlin advises students to see where graduates of the courses go on to work. This may be available online while college admission or careers offices will have tracked graduate destinations too.",,10/26/21 0:00,"After Christmas ‚Äì and particularly coming into April ‚Äì the demands of the Leaving Cert have a sneaky habit of creeping up on you, leaving you with a little less time for considering courses and career options.

Those who don't have their first dose by the deadline can't work unless they have a recognized medical exemption.

Planning on attending an open day? Do your homework first,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/planning-on-attending-an-open-day-do-your-homework-first-1.4703410?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"The country‚Äôs third-level campuses have been silent for the past 18 months. Small groups of students and staff may have been present for essential laboratory or practical classes but until recent weeks the normal activity associated with college life has been absent. Now, Ireland‚Äôs institutions have sprung back to life with freshers and second-year students on campus, for the first time in most cases. Unfortunately, as colleges are still exercising a good degree of caution in order to protect staff and students, in-person open days are still some distance off for some institutions. However, all third-level colleges hope to be able to bring prospective 2022 students on to campus before the end of the academic year, because the opportunity to physically experience the college environment ‚Äì even if just for a few hours ‚Äì can kickstart the process of thinking about the importance of maximising your performance in the Leaving Cert, as you consider the next step on your life-long career journey. It can also bring a greater focus to your interactions with your school guidance counsellor as you work together to identify the most suitable course option to pursue following the completion of your school life in June 2022. Whether you experience open days virtually or in person, the key to successfully making the transition to higher or further education is to concentrate on the suitability of the curriculum content, college facilities, availability of accommodation, or public transport links rather than the desired occupational area or specific job which they may hope to progress to following graduation. That task can become the focus of attention in four- or five-years‚Äô time, when college life is coming to an end and the needs of the labour market in 2027/8 have become clear. Basic research Whatever the nature of the coming open days, you should undertake some basic research about the colleges you are considering and their course offerings prior to each event. After all, depending on the decision you will make by the close of the CAO course selection process on July 1st, 2022, and the course offer you eventually secure next August, you are committing several years of your life to this next stage of study and learning. You have probably already read the 2022 CAO Handbook and are exploring all third level and further educational college courses on offer in Ireland qualifax.ie. More than 6,000 students attended The Irish Times virtual Higher Options conference earlier this month, where they attended talks from experts in the field of further and higher education and spoke virtually to representatives of many colleges and courses. Of course Leaving Cert students are not only considering courses offered through the CAO. Thousands choose to study at their local Further Education (FE) college, where they can secure level 5 and 6 QQI awards facilitating entry to employment or into those CAO courses which reserve a percentage of their first-year undergraduate places for FE graduates. All FE colleges operate their own open days, often holding several such events throughout the academic year. Several thousand Irish students will apply for courses in Northern Ireland (particularly those living near the Border), Scotland or, in some cases, England, notwithstanding the ¬£9,250 yearly fees. These applications are made through the UK Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (ucas.com). Some 2,200 Republic of Ireland applicants made that choice this year, including 850 who went to Northern Ireland. EU citizens can study in any EU country under the same terms and conditions as in their own country and thousands of Irish students have in the past 10 years chosen to study at one of the more than 1,000 courses taught through English in continental EU universities. These EU colleges also host virtual and in-person open days which Irish students can attend ‚Äì low-cost air fares should help minimise the expense involved in attending such events. You can find out more about these events from the European Universities Central Application Support Service (eunicas.ie). Course content When exploring college options, be aware that the course is only a small part of what you will experience when you arrive on registration day in late August next year to start college life. You will be entering a community that will help shape you for the rest of your life. In our personal relationships we take time getting to know other people and every aspect of their personality before we commit to them. Selecting a course that will commit you to living your life within that community for at least three years should be considered just as carefully. The only way to evaluate whether a college is right for you is to explore all aspects of its life as fully as you can on its open day and see whether it feels right. This is more than an intellectual exercise. As a guidance counsellor and teacher for more than 40 years, I have dealt with many students whose minds were full of facts and figures about dozens of courses but could not differentiate between them. They were lost in a sea of data, with no guiding compass to make the right choice. Finest attire Would you commit yourself to a relationship with someone based on reading a fact sheet about their life so far? On a college open day, you will see the institution put its best foot forward. It is dressed in its finest attire, full of presentations, smiling student ambassadors, friendly lecturers and goodie bags, all designed to present the college in its best light. It can be hard to see the true nature of college life from such an experience. But you can see through a certain amount of the perfect presentation that every college puts on during open days, to the reality that lies behind. If you are particularly impressed with a college or course after an open day, observing whatever Covid-19 restrictions are in place at the time, try to go back on an ordinary day and wander around, to see if day-to-day normality gels with its open-day presentation.",,10/26/21 1:00,"The country‚Äôs third-level campuses have been silent for the past 18 months.

Selecting a course that will commit you to living your life within that community for at least three years should be considered just as carefully. The only way to evaluate whether a college is right for you is to explore all aspects of its life as fully as you can on its open day and see whether it feels right. This is more than an intellectual exercise. As a guidance counsellor and teacher for more than 40 years, I have dealt with many students whose minds were full of facts and figures about dozens of courses but could not differentiate between them. They were lost in a sea of data, with no guiding compass to make the right choice. Would you commit yourself to a relationship with someone based on reading a fact sheet about their life so far? On a college open day, you will see the institution put its best foot forward. It is dressed in its finest attire, full of presentations, smiling student ambassadors, friendly lecturers and goodie bags, all designed to present the college in its best light. It can be hard to see the true nature of college life from such an experience. But you can see through a certain amount of the perfect presentation that every college puts on during open days, to the reality that lies behind. If you are particularly impressed with a college or course after an open day, observing whatever Covid-19 restrictions are in place at the time, try to go back on an ordinary day and wander around, to see if day-to-day normality gels with its open-day presentation.",https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4703409.1634571623!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg,irishtimes

Judge: No order barring union from discussing vaccine order,https://www.nsnews.com/coronavirus-covid-19-national-news/judge-no-order-barring-union-from-discussing-vaccine-order-4550426,,['Canadian Press'],,CHICAGO (AP) ‚Äî An order barring the president of the police union from making public statements encouraging members to disobey the city‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine mandate expired after a judge on Monday denied a request to extend it.,,10/26/21 1:27,"CHICAGO (AP) ‚Äî An order barring the president of the police union from making public statements encouraging members to disobey the city‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine mandate expired after a judge on Monday denied a request to extend it. Earlier this month, Cook County Judge Cecilia Horan granted the city‚Äôs request for a temporary restraining order. After hearing arguments Monday, she issued a written ruling denying the city of Chicago's renewal and expansion request saying the situation had ‚Äúmaterially changed.‚Äù City attorneys wanted the order extended to include other union leaders in addition to Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara, accusing him of continuing to speak out or having other union officials do so in his place. ‚ÄúMr. Catanzara continues to make statements that if not cross the line, come right up to over and certainly his toes are crossing the line,‚Äù Mike Warner, an attorney for the city, said. ‚ÄúThese statements are adding gasoline to the fire. They are urging his members to engage in an unlawful act.‚Äù City employees have to be vaccinated by year's end with few exceptions or risk losing their jobs. Most departments complied with an initial deadline this month to report their status, but the police department has lagged behind in the escalating legal fight with the city. The city argued the union‚Äôs actions amounted to encouraging a work stoppage while union attorneys said the matter is part of a unfair labor dispute and the vaccine mandate was ordered without union input. Horan said that the situation since the first injunction had changed since the Oct. 15 deadline to submit vaccination had passed and ‚Äúthe threatened work stoppage has not come to pass.‚Äù Catanzara has directed members to defy the city‚Äôs requirement and been outspoken in recent days on social media and in person. He spoke Monday to dozens of of protesters gathered outside Chicago‚Äôs City Hall and during a City Council meeting. ‚ÄúThis is not the way a government is supposed to run. It is not a queen on that throne. It is a mayor,‚Äù he said during the meeting, adding that there'd be ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù of officers defying the order. He asked aldermen to back the union and support a proposal requiring council approval for policies that govern disciplining city employees, saying those who didn't would see challengers in the 2023 municipal election. Chicago police leaders, who call the vaccine mandate a matter of protecting officers and the public, have said less than two dozen officers haven't complied with the order to the point of risking their employment. The city's order allows for a temporary window of regular COVID-19 testing at the employee‚Äôs own expense until vaccines can be administered. Police Superintendent David Brown said Monday that 23 department employees were placed on ‚Äúno-pay status‚Äù for failing to comply with the order. About 70% of department employees have reported their vaccination status, of which 80% are fully vaccinated, numbers that have recently increased. ‚ÄúWe want to stay focused on protecting the people of Chicago. That includes the police officers of this department,‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúSo we really see this as a life-saving effort for police officers ... Part of that means following through on the vaccine mandate.‚Äù ___ Associated Press reporter Kathleen Foody contributed to this report. Sophia Tareen, The Associated Press",,nsnews

The post What It‚Äôs Like To Voice My Hero Academia From Home, According To The Actors appeared first on Gizmodo Australia.","World Heroes Mission, the third movie to spring from the exceedingly popular shonen anime series My Hero Academia, is about to arrive in theatres. Ahead of the theatrical release, I spoke to the film‚Äôs voice actors about the evolution of their characters and how they‚Äôve adjusted to working from home during the pandemic. World Heroes Mission follows Izuku Midoriya, Katsuki Bakugo, and Shoto Todoroki shortly after their hero internship with Shoto‚Äôs father and the number-one Pro Hero, Endeavour. Midoriya and his new friend Rody Soul are framed for a crime they didn‚Äôt commit and must clear their names, while also having only two hours to save the world from new villain Flect Turn ‚Äî who is on a mission to cleanse the world of quirks (that is, people with superpowers). The regular cast, plus newcomers Series newcomers Ryan Colt Levy and Robbie Daymond, who play Rody and Flect respectively, said they felt right at home joining the cast in portraying their characters on the big screen. ‚ÄúI think the coolest part about being in the films from an aspect of being thrust into a larger world as a whole is that it tells a nice little self-contained story,‚Äù Daymond said. ‚ÄúFor us as newbies, that‚Äôs a gift because we just get to be a part of that and ride that arc out. [‚Ä¶] Thankfully these characters are wonderfully fleshed out [and] the writing‚Äôs really enjoyable. It makes our job a lot easier.‚Äù For Levy, it was easy to bring Rody to life because he said they shared odd similarities ‚Äî which he didn‚Äôt elaborate on ‚Äî that let him feel his way through portraying the sun-kissed hero without thinking too much about how he sounded while doing so. ‚ÄúEven though I‚Äôve adored the show for so long, [I had to] kind of turn off my fanboy brain and let myself just exist in this thing and let it be spontaneous,‚Äù Levy said. ‚ÄúThat was the only way I could really give Rody what he needed.‚Äù Justin Briner, who voices series main protagonist Midoriya, said each character‚Äôs growth has been rewarding for both himself and fans who‚Äôve followed Midoriya on his journey to becoming the world‚Äôs number-one hero, Deku, over the past five seasons. ‚ÄúDeku has come a long way. He‚Äôs definitely added some tools to his belt, he‚Äôs grown more confident [and] he‚Äôs been able to rely more on his friends and gain more friends over time,‚Äù Briner said. Clifford Chapin, Bakugo‚Äôs actor, said the hot-headed hero in training has grown a lot during season five‚Äôs Endeavour Agency arc and ‚Äúa little bit‚Äù in the movie as well. ‚ÄúGoing from someone who‚Äôs so antagonistic, especially towards Deku, [and being] so abrasive and difficult for his classmates at the beginning of the series; we‚Äôve seen him be humbled and have to learn how to work together with other people,‚Äù he said. When it comes to tumultuous relationships that have had heightened emotions as the season has developed, one relationship that rivals that of Deku and Bakugo is that of the new number-one hero Endeavour and his son Shoto. David Matranga and Patrick Seitz, voice actors for Shoto and Endeavour, said they informed their portrayals of the pair‚Äôs raucous relationship from their lived experiences with their fathers. Shoto and Endeavour‚Äôs relationship felt like ‚Äúbingo‚Äù for Seitz, allowing him to see the ‚Äúsquares‚Äù he‚Äôd covered in his own life and the squares he would have to portray in Endeavour and Shoto‚Äôs relationship.This provided him moments of introspection regarding when he and his father didn‚Äôt see eye-to-eye. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre like, ok, here was a dude that was trying his best imperfectly and you can take it or you can leave it. That‚Äôs sort of the same thing with Endeavour,‚Äù Seitz said. Although Matranga didn‚Äôt go through the same conflict of being forced into becoming a child prodigy like Shoto, he relates to the character in that they both live inside their own heads and can be hard on themselves while pursuing their ambitions. Matranga said fans will see the character a bit freer and more confident in his ability not only in using his powers but in communicating with his teammates. For Seitz, seeing their characters work on improving themselves in the show proper pays off in dividends in World Heroes Mission in subtle ways that are deserved for both father and son. ‚ÄúShoto and Endeavour both are not open books. Endeavour‚Äôs BS is a part of Shoto‚Äôs BS ‚Äòcause that‚Äôs the parent-child dynamics since the dawn of time,‚Äù he said. Although subtlety is not a virtue of his, Seitz said playing Endeavour has been a rewarding experience for him. Endeavour‚Äôs ‚Äúglacial pace‚Äù at improving not only himself and his relationship with Shoto provided ‚Äúsweet payoff‚Äù for Seitz. Dubbing from home is an acquired taste While the characters in the film had to overcome a global crisis in the form of Flect Turn, their voice actors had to tackle one of their own when it came to bringing their characters to life, either in a hybrid studio setting or working from home in their own booths. Luckily for the voice-acting community, working from home was already an initiative that was in effect before the pandemic, with many anime from the past few seasons being dubbed from the safety of the actors‚Äô homes. When it came to maintaining their characters‚Äô chemistry through line delivery, the My Hero Academia voice actors said ultimately it has been business as usual given that they‚Äôre still able to riff off other actors‚Äô previously recorded audio. When it came to dubbing the movie during the pandemic, Levy was able to record his lines in a hybrid setting where he would be remote some days recording from his home in Texas with Colleen Clinkenbeard, fellow voice actor and Funimation‚Äôs ADR and line producer, as well as working from a studio, which he had missed dearly. After being stuck in his home booth for a year, he said getting to go into a studio again was very freeing. Similarly, Daymond was also able to record his lines in a studio as well as from home in his ‚Äúmonolith‚Äù of a voiceover booth he built himself that he doesn‚Äôt wish to use ‚Äúever again.‚Äù He said he feels safe in studios thanks to LA being good with covid-19 protocols and providing UV air filters, tests, and ‚Äúlots of time between [sessions]‚Äù for voice actors. ‚ÄúMy favourite part about this job is the people, regardless of whether they‚Äôre on the other side of the glass or not, and to not have to set my own levels and do my own engineering and all of that, and be able to just be in the space and concentrate solely on the performance. I think that‚Äôs how it was meant to be‚Äù Daymond added. ‚ÄúNot complaining mind you, we as voice actors, were very fortunate to be able to transition into remote over covid and continue to work. I‚Äôve got a lot of friends on camera who weren‚Äôt able to do that. And a lot of people in production‚Äôs lives were uprooted just like the rest of us. Fortunately [in] voiceover, we were able to carry on and continue to make cartoons, video games, and anime.‚Äù As for the series‚Äô new voice actors, daily rituals old and new have kept them grounded before going into their booths. ‚ÄúEvery day before my session, I light a little fire and I cover it from the wind and cold. That‚Äôs the flame of voiceover that keeps burning in my soul before I step into my booth,‚Äù Daymond said. ‚ÄúThat, and I also like to take a nice walk in the mornings before my sessions.‚Äù Daymond might be new to Hero Aca, but he nailed All Might‚Äôs One For All imagery to a T. Mayhaps he has the quirk flowing through his lungs? Levy, who admits to still being new to the acting industry, said living a long life of working jobs he didn‚Äôt necessarily enjoy and rising to meet the day helped him prepare for this ‚Äúdream job‚Äù of acting in World Heroes Mission. He said that even on the worst days of cabin fever, he could ‚Äúescape to another universe, and that was extraordinary.‚Äù What Seitz realised after recording remotely is that even though at-home solo sessions feel like a solitary pursuit, not being in the same place as his engineer and director made him miss the kinship he‚Äôd normally have with his team. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I ever fully realised how much communion I had with those people in the moment, even though there was a window between us,‚Äù he said. For Seitz, recording ‚Äúhit different‚Äù when the production team had to work from the confines of their homes. Despite the growing pains, Seitz said it‚Äôs ‚Äúmind-blowing‚Äù that dubbing from home is as viable a solution as it is. Mantranga said he has to remember to not become too comfortable when recording there.He said sometimes he has to remind himself, ‚Äú‚ÄôHey, you‚Äôre really doing this here. You can‚Äôt just roll out of bed and go to work. You have to maintain that professional aspect no matter where you are.‚Äù he said. Bakugo‚Äôs actor, Chapin, was fortunate to be able to set up a booth at home that he said was largely comparable to a recording studio at Funimation. ‚ÄúThe only thing that ever kinda affects anything is sometimes your internet dips,‚Äù he said, adding that this has been known to screw up some of the many big screams he does for Bakugo. ‚ÄúSometimes the internet will just eat it and I‚Äôll have done this big scream and we‚Äôll play it back and it‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòAhh-rrrr-aaa-rrr-ahh!‚Äô because the internet slows down for one second. So, then I have to do it again,‚Äù Chapin said. Funimation set up recording schedules for the local voice actors to record in its Texas studio, which felt like ‚Äúcoming home‚Äù for Chapin. He thinks there is going to be a continued use of hybrid system moving forward, especially once people continue to improve their home setups to the point where they get closer to the one-to-one sound found in bespoke voiceover studios. ‚ÄúWith a show such as My Hero Academia, where the cast is expanding rapidly every episode, every season, every movie, it‚Äôs great to have [dubbing from home] available to us [and] that we‚Äôre able to work with actors that maybe aren‚Äôt available normally, or just up the street who can just come into the studio,‚Äù he said. In fact, Briner thinks the rise in home studios has been a great innovation for both the short- and long-term of the industry. He sees the trend as an ‚Äúelegant solution‚Äù in part because it‚Äôs provided actors access to studios they might not have been able to work with before. That said, Briner would love to get back into a typical studio environment because that‚Äôs where he started his career, and it‚Äôs where he‚Äôs most comfortable. Plus, they tend to have better equipment. ‚ÄúIn the meantime, until it‚Äôs safe [and] until everyone‚Äôs ready, I think this has been very rewarding for a lot of people, in a lot of different ways.‚Äù My Hero Academia: World Heroes Mission comes to theatres and the Funimation streaming service on October 29.

'Green Crackers' must be made popular,https://www.sentinelassam.com/editorial/green-crackers-must-be-made-popular-560457,"['Editorial,More']",['Sentinel Digital Desk'],,"The APCB (Assam Pollution Control Board) allowing bursting of only green crackers with a two-hour window period during Deepawali, Chhath puja","The APCB (Assam Pollution Control Board) allowing bursting of only green crackers with a two-hour window period during Deepawali, Chhath puja, Christmas and New Year eve and prohibiting all other types of crackers is critical to keep air pollution in check across the State. Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma's taking to the Tweeter a day after that the APCB clamped the ban suo moto without any consultation with the State Government has added to the confusion. The Chief Minister assuring that ""the entire issue is being reviewed afresh, holistically, keeping people's sentiments in mind"" has kept alive the possibility of the 'window-period extension"". The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) has defined green crackers as ""improved fireworks/firecrackers"" made with the reduction in shell size, elimination of ash usage, reduced usage of raw materials ‚Äî which reduces the emission of particulate matter (PM) by a minimum range from 30 % to 20% reduction in PM and the rest 10% in gaseous emission when compared with the conventional composition for a given category of crackers/fireworks. The APCB prohibition is a compliance of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order, imposing a total ban on crackers during COVID-19 pandemic in all cities and towns where the air quality falls under the ""poor and above category""; and allowing the sale and use of only green crackers in cities and towns with ""moderate"" air quality. The Supreme Court also refused to interfere with the NGT order and directed all district magistrates to ensure that prohibited firecrackers are not sold and compensation is recovered from violators. Air Quality Index of Guwahati, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Monday was found to be in the ""moderate"" category (AQI value between 101-200) which led to APCB allowing sale and use of green crackers for two hours in the capital city on the festival days. Improving air quality has gained more prominence following outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. While air quality of moderate category causes breathing or health related discomfort among elderly, children, pregnant women, people with asthma or other lung and respiratory diseases and heart diseases, prolonged exposure to ""poor"" category air can cause breathing discomfort in healthy people too. The Indian-firecracker industry produces an estimated Rs 3,000 crore worth of firecrackers, but production declined to Rs 1,500 crore last year due to the ban. Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu accounts for around 90% of the production and over 1000 manufacturers employ about three lakh workers and provide indirect employment to about five lakh people. Ensuring the SC ban on the use of toxic chemicals in the manufacturing of firecrackers has remained a cause of worry; and, this leaves room for speculation if the firecrackers manufactured in Sivakasi are actually green. The SC also observed that during an investigation, the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) found that six manufactures of Tamil Nadu used barium and barium salts in violation of the apex Court's order.Smuggling and sale of unsafe, cheap, polluting, and harmful Chinese crackers into India has become a headache for the Customs authorities. According to an estimate by the Indian firecracker industry, such illegal and unsafe Chinese crackers account for about 40% of total firecrackers sold in India. If the authorities fail to prevent illegal import of Chinese firecrackers which found way to markets in different cities and towns then enforcement of green crackers cannot be expected to produce the desired objective of reducing air pollution. The Chinese firecrackers are not subjected to any laboratory tests to ascertain the chemicals used and also the percentage of PM emission because of illegal import. It has further raised the awareness level of people about the importance of green crackers; and the harmful effects of unsafe Chinese crackers have received the least priority. As a result, they fall for cheaper firecrackers. For over 130 years, Assam's firecracker manufacturing hub in Barpeta has been traditionally producing green crackers which emit less pollution and makes low decibel sound to make it a real celebration of the festival of lights (Deepavali) in the true sense of the term and not reduce the festival to a celebration of polluting high decibel sound and choking gases. For the traditional firecrackers industry of the State to capture a bigger market taking advantage of the NGT ban and the SC directives, laboratory certification and labelling that the firecrackers manufactured in Barpeta are ""Green"" as defined by the CSIR-NEERI is important. Financial and other support by the State Government can not only help to expand the current market size of this indigenous industry from around Rs one crore within Assam but also capture the markets outside the Northeast region and generate gainful employment. The Assam Police have demonstrated their capability in cracking down against the illicit drugs and seized massive quantities of these banned narcotic items.

Covid-19 antigen tests ‚Äòreducing spread‚Äô in meat plants,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/covid-19-antigen-tests-reducing-spread-in-meat-plants-1.4710038?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"Antigen testing in meat plants since March has reduced the risk of Covid-19 outbreaks and made them safer, the Department of Agriculture‚Äôs director of laboratories has said. The department has been overseeing antigen testing of 4,000 workers in meat plants every week after a pilot in January found that the rapid antigen tests picked up about four out of five positive results confirmed by PCR tests, the standard and more sensitive test used by the HSE. Dr Donal Sammin, assistant secretary of the department who is in charge of the testing programme, said antigen testing was ‚Äúperfectly good enough‚Äù at preventing the spread of Covid-19 in meat plants where the circulation of chilled air encouraged the transmission of the virus. He told The Irish Times that the antigen tests had allowed food businesses to pick out and remove workers most likely to transmit infection quickly from the factories before there was a chance of a ‚Äúsuper-spreading event occurring in the plant‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt is not as sensitive as PCR, but it‚Äôs a good measure of infectivity. Our use of this test wasn‚Äôt so much to use it as an accurate diagnostic in individual workers; it was about using it as a risk-reduction tool in a population of people to make the workplace safer for all,‚Äù he said. Long resisted by public health officials because of concerns about their accuracy, the general use of antigen tests is only now being given an enhanced role in the Government‚Äôs response to Covid-19. Asymptomatic people In an effort to suppress the spread of the virus, the State will send antigen test kits to fully vaccinated asymptomatic people who are found to be close contacts of confirmed cases. The Department of Agriculture found antigen testing to be effective in a validation study carried out on meat workers at the start of this year. Tests on 5,111 workers in 17 meat plants in January compared antigen and PCR test results and found that 41 people tested positive on both tests. Some 79 tested positive on the PCR tests but when the viral load was taken into account and those least likely to be infectious ‚Äì or those who possibly had the virus previously and were no longer infectious ‚Äì the antigen test picked up 79 per cent of positives confirmed by the PCR tests. ‚ÄúWhen we look at those PCR positives, a rapid test is picking up four out of five of those so it is doing exactly what we would hope it would do,‚Äù said Dr Sammin. The sample found just two false positives out of the sample. ‚ÄúOne of the fears people have had about these rapid tests is that you might be getting a lot of false positives; that has not been our experience,‚Äù he said.

Beginning Nov. 8, foreign, non-immigrant adults traveling to the United States will need to be fully vaccinated, with only limited exceptions, and all travelers will need to be tested for the virus before boarding a plane to the U.S. There will be tightened restrictions for American and foreign citizens who are not fully vaccinated.

Story continues below advertisement It also reflects the White House‚Äôs embrace of vaccination requirements as a tool to push more Americans to get the shots by making it inconvenient to remain unvaccinated. Under the policy, those who are vaccinated will need to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test within three days of travel, while the unvaccinated must present a test taken within one day of travel. Children under 18 will not be required to be fully vaccinated because of delays in making them eligible for vaccines in many places.

That includes Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and China‚Äôs Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines. Mixing-and-matching of approved shots will be permitted.

The new rules will replace restrictions that began in January 2020, when President Donald Trump banned most non-U.S. citizens coming from China.

Philip Murphy's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, taxation and COVID executive orders on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""",,10/26/21 2:46,"close Video NJ gov candidate Jack Ciattarelli responds to Murphy's comments about lockdown orders Republican challenger tells 'Tucker Carlson Tonight' the Democrat is 'way to extreme' for the blue Garden State. New Jersey Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli joined "" Tucker Carlson Tonight "" on Monday to respond to Gov. Philip Murphy's taxation policies and previous comments about whether the consideration that his socioeconomic lockdown orders violated the Constitution might be ""above my pay grade."" Host Tucker Carlson reminded the audience of Murphy's last appearance on the program in April 2020 -- when New Jersey and its surrounding Democrat-run states instituted sweeping mandates against religious or family gatherings and operations of businesses like gyms and restaurants . In April 2020, Carlson asked Murphy about a case in which 15 men were arrested for congregating at a Lakewood, N.J., synagogue for the funeral of Orthodox Rabbi Chaim Moshe Strulovics in violation of his executive order banning large gatherings. 'The Bill of Rights, as you well know, protects Americans' rights ‚Äî enshrines their right to practice their religion as they see fit and to congregate together to assemble peacefully,"" Carlson said. ""By what authority did you nullify the Bill of Rights in issuing this order? How do you have the power to do that?"" ""That's above my pay grade, Tucker,"" Murphy responded. ""I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this ... we looked at all the data and the science and it says people have to stay away from each other. That is the best thing we can do to break the back of the curve of this virus, that leads to lower hospitalization and ultimately fatalities.""

(AP Photo/Stefan Jeremiah) In response, Ciattarelli said that while Democrats hold about a 1 million voter advantage in the Garden State, many New Jersey Democrats are ""fiscally conservative and socially moderate."" ""This guy is just way too extreme,"" he said, noting that no Democratic governor has been reelected in the state since Gov. Brendan Byrne in the late 1970s. Carlson went on to compare Murphy to former Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat of the early 1990s whose plan to hike taxes in the billions upset so many New Jersey voters that they responded by giving Republicans their first legislative majority in Trenton in decades. ""Phil Murphy has done the same thing [as Jim Florio], he's gone way too far left,"" replied Ciattarelli, formerly a state lawmaker and county freeholder from Somerset. ""A year and a half ago on this very show, [Murphy claimed] ‚Äòthe Bill of Rights is above my pay grade‚Äô. -- It‚Äôs not funny. But worse than that, he told the highest taxed people in the nation ‚Äò if taxes are issue, we are probably not your state ‚Äô."" Incumbent Gov.

Aussie comic slammed for ‚Äòdisgusting‚Äô joke,https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/abbie-chatfield-slams-comedian-nikki-osborne-for-disgusting-weinstein-joke/news-story/d57cf6b5777feb777c1aa9df934b8a63,,,,Australian comedian Nikki Osborne has earned the ire of two reality stars after posting a questionable meme featuring Harvey Weinstein in relation to the Covid vaccine.,,10/26/21 2:57,"Australian comedian Nikki Osborne has earned the ire of two reality stars after posting a questionable meme featuring Harvey Weinstein in relation to the Covid vaccine. The meme featured convicted sex offender Harvey Weinstein alongside actor Lindsay Lohan, with the caption: ‚ÄúThe original no jab, no job‚Äù, seemingly comparing vaccine mandates to Weinstein‚Äôs horrific ‚Äòcasting couch‚Äô crimes which sparked the #MeToo movement. The disgraced film producer is currently serving a 23-year sentence after being found guilty of rape and sexual assault last year . Just For Laughs host Osborne deleted the image shortly after posting, but not before it was picked up by former reality star and podcaster Abbie Chatfield, and subsequently former Bachelor himself, Matt Agnew. In a series of videos shared to her Instagram Stories on Monday, Abbie began by saying she assumes Nikki isn‚Äôt anti vax ‚Äúbecause that would be awkward for a live performer‚Äù. ‚ÄúImagine a female in the industry to think it‚Äôs funny to make fun of rape and sexual assault victims. Jokes about rape aren‚Äôt funny. Unless it‚Äôs about your own sexual assault as a coping mechanism. ‚ÄúHave you been sexually assaulted Nikki? If you have, what are you doing? If you haven‚Äôt, what are you doing? Have you got a friend who has been raped? Because most people have.‚Äù Abbie went on: ‚ÄúSo for you to sit there and make a joke likening the vaccine that is saving lives to rape ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre anti-vax but it‚Äôs a ridiculous joke. Likening the vaccine to rape is one of the most disgusting things I have seen in my entire life. ‚ÄúImagine being so s**t at comedy that you have to make fun of rape victims,‚Äù she added. In his own response to Osborne‚Äôs post , former Bachelor Matt Agnew, whose season featured as Abbie runner-up, began with a trigger warning for sexual abuse and assault. ‚ÄúNikki Osborne has put out into the world very publicly a joke, and I think it is of paramount importance to address some enormous issues with said ‚Äújoke‚Äù. As always, it is the points I want to discuss and challenge, not the person,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFront and centre of the joke is an image of Harvey Weinstein whose systematic, decades-long sexual harassment and sexual abuse led to the vitality of the #MeToo movement. The #MeToo movement, founded by sexual assault survivor and activist Tarana Burke, is a confronting and sobering reminder that male sexual violence, harassment and abuse towards women is not new, and not uncommon,‚Äù he wrote. In dot points, Agnew discussed the importance of men contributing to change towards the normalisation of rape humour, calling the style of joke ‚Äúdistasteful‚Äù, and including a quote about what counts as ‚Äúhumour‚Äù in the social sphere. He included a slide on freedom of speech, writing: ‚ÄúThe moment you broadcast your thoughts, opinions, ‚Äújokes‚Äù, whatever else publicly: you are open to criticism. ‚ÄúWhile I strongly condemn ad hominem attacks, trolling, and personal vitriol, there are those who will engage is such disrespectful commentary and they do, unfortunately, have every right to do that,‚Äù he wrote. Nikki posted a reply to the outrage on her Instagram Stories on Monday evening, writing: ‚ÄúDear Mob, You‚Äôve been misinformed. Your quarrel is not with me. I‚Äôm on your team. Warmest, Casting couch survivor‚Äù. Earlier this month, Agnew was praised for his thoughts on Sam Frost‚Äôs vaccination status , after the Home And Away star posted an emotional five-minute video revealing she has chosen not to get vaccinated against Covid, pleading for ‚Äúcompassion‚Äù and ‚Äúempathy‚Äù for those who have made the same decision as her. The astrophysicist said he didn‚Äôt want to contribute to the ‚Äúpile on‚Äù against Frost, who said in the video she needed to look after her mental health while she waited until December 1 when the unvaccinated can enjoy the same freedoms as those who‚Äôve been double-jabbed. ‚ÄúSam Frost has opened up with a lengthy monologue about being unvaccinated. At it‚Äôs simplest, it‚Äôs a dog whistle,‚Äù Agnew began, a political term used to describe messaging aimed at fringe or niche groups while appearing ‚Äúsuperficially unobjectionable.‚Äù He then outlined his four issues with the video, listed in full here . The Crown will depict a controversial part of Princess Diana‚Äôs life despite declarations by Prince William that it should never again be seen. They were Hollywood‚Äôs most high-profile gay couple ‚Äì but in a new interview, Anne Heche reveals the downside of her relationship with Ellen.

It became evident after two blasts shook Zimbabwe's Mazowe district late last week. The two gas explosions left eight people dead including six Chinese nationals. The police is investigating the cause of explosion.The incident happened at the mine about 50 km (30 miles) north of the capital, Harare, police said. While villagers mourned the death of a local but had no sympathy for the Chinese nationals. It was reported that villagers from around SAS Mine in Mazowe expressed joy following the death of six Chinese nationals who were managers at the site. The villagers described the late Chinese managers as 'stubborn' and very dis-respectful who ill-treated locals. The local news website reported that the local councillor Taera Tapererwa, from Mazowe South Ward 2 confirmed that the Chinese managers were quite rude to the employees. A worker at the mine reportedly told that Chinese managers had ignored warnings. Nor did they show any remorse over the death of the first victim. The second explosion took lives of six Chinese and that was when it was accepted that the situation was dangerous at the mine. Available reports suggest that there is a fear among the locals that China would take away their assets if Zimbabwe fails to return loan amount. China has done heavy investment by providing huge loans to Zimbabwe. Local newspapers have reported from time to time that Chinese companies have been ill treating local labour and not paying respectable wages. An incident was reported where local employees were shot dead by a Chinese employer at a mine when the labourers demanded their legitimate outstanding wages. There have been several incidents where Chinese company owners have not paid any heed to Zimbabwean law, the citizens' legal rights and instead discriminated against them from the onsite Chinese miners by paying them low wages of merely 35 US dollars per month. Also there have been cases where Chinese employers have assaulted local employees by forcing them to work in dangerous, inhuman, harsh, and life-threatening conditions which amount to slavery. In pandemic time too, Chinese companies have reportedly ignored Covid-19 guidelines and forced employees to stay together. In one incident, 16 employees were reportedly forced to stay in just one room. On several occasions, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Union (ZCTU) has raised objections against the assault of local workers by Chinese employers. ZCTU has been taking up issues with Chinese companies following complaints of exploitation of local employees. In June, Chinese ceramic tiles manufacturing company Sunny Yi Feng had entered into a war of words with the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) over claims of labour rights abuse, including unsafe working and living conditions. In absence of any legal action, ZCTU had launched a social media campaign to raise awareness about the working and living conditions of the workers in the factories. The Chinese company called ZCTU's actions as ""corporate bullying"" motivated by ""hidden agenda"". Several other allegations have been levelled against Chinese companies operating in Zimbabwe. According to 2016 report by the Brookings Institution, there are at least 10,000 Chinese nationals in Zimbabwe, many of whom work in mining, telecommunications, and construction sectors. Chinese-owned companies, however, have become notorious for ill-treatment of workers. There were reports of workers' strike in a mining company against low wages in 2019. These workers also demanded safety kit as they were getting exposed to hazardous fumes.

It was the Astros‚Äô first trip to The Bronx since their sign-stealing scandal during their World Series title season was exposed. Jose Altuve drew most of the attention, hearing ‚ÄúF‚Äìk Altuve‚Äù and the rest of the team subjected to ‚ÄúF‚Äìk the Astros‚Äù throughout the series. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve seen that,‚Äô‚Äô Yankee manager Aaron Boone said at the time. ‚ÄúIt was definitely an energetic crowd. They expressed themselves.‚Äù Despite all that ‚Äî and their place in history forever tainted by garbage cans and video monitors in a scandal that cost A.J. Hinch his job as manager, Jeff Luhnow as general manager and caused bench coach Alex Cora to be suspended for a season and Carlos Beltran to lose the Mets managerial job ‚Äî Houston has a chance to change the narrative with a win in this World Series against the Braves. Just don‚Äôt mention any of it to the Astros. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre playing here in the World Series because we‚Äôre motivated to go out there and prove people that we‚Äôre a really good team,‚Äô‚Äô Carlos Correa said Monday as the team prepared to play Game 1 of the World Series at Minute Maid Park. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just here because we worked really hard from the moment we showed up to spring training because the loss last year, one win away from the World Series is bittersweet. And we just want to really show the world that we‚Äôre the best team out there. ‚Ä¶ In order for us to do that, we‚Äôve got to get four more wins.‚Äù The shortstop was more open about the situation in the aftermath of the Astros‚Äô ALCS win over the Red Sox, saying to the Washington Post: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs extra-special after everything we‚Äôve been through as a team, as a family. Our motivation is to show the world how great we really are.‚Äù They lost the ALCS a year ago, fell in the World Series in 2019 and the ALCS in 2018. In Dusty Baker‚Äôs second year at the helm, the Astros are back in the World Series for the third time in five seasons. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs their main source of motivation,‚Äô‚Äô Baker said of his players ‚Äî namely Correa, Altuve, Alex Bregman and Yuli Gurriel ‚Äî who were in Houston in 2017. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I think people are trying to make it as their main source of motivation, but that doesn‚Äôt motivate you nearly as much as just driving to win and driving for excellence. You can only be driven by ‚ÄòI‚Äôll show you,‚Äô or you can only be driven by negative motivation so far. I think this team is way past that because they know they can play.‚Äù They‚Äôve proven that with their success since ‚Äô17, even as suspicion surrounded their win two years later, when Altuve grabbed his jersey and told his teammates not to rip it off after hitting a walk-off homer in Game 6 of the 2019 ALCS against the Yankees. At the time, many believed Altuve was wearing a buzzer to help signal what pitch was coming, but an MLB investigation showed no evidence that was the case. Altuve said history wasn‚Äôt on his mind: ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt thought about that, but I think we have the same mindset we always have, just going out there and try to win.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worried about narratives,‚Äô‚Äô Bregman said. ‚ÄúI want to win four games. I want to play good baseball with this team, to be honest with you ‚Ä¶ the only thing on my mind is execution. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs what postseason winning baseball is all about is execution. Not any other stuff.‚Äô‚Äô Correa agreed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the outside noise motivates us at all,‚Äô‚Äô Correa said. ‚ÄúI just want to make sure that we do things right. We play baseball the right way, and we have fun doing it.‚Äù But Michael Brantley, who didn‚Äôt get to the Astros until 2019, said the reception of crowds outside Houston have toughened their skin. ‚ÄúWe get it everywhere we go,‚Äô‚Äô Brantley said. ‚ÄúWhat makes this team so special is we‚Äôve been here, done that.

"Covid cases falling, but trouble signs arise as winter looms in US",https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/covid-cases-falling-but-trouble-signs-arise-in-us-1869379-2021-10-26?utm_source=rss,,,,"Covid cases falling, but trouble signs arise as winter looms in US",,10/26/21 3:41,"Tumbling Covid-19 case counts have some schools around the US considering relaxing their mask rules, but deaths nationally have been ticking up over the past few weeks, some rural hospitals are showing signs of strain, and cold weather is setting in. The number of new cases nationally has been plummeting since the delta surge peaked in mid-September. The US is averaging about 73,000 new cases per day, dramatically lower than the 173,000 recorded on September 13. And the number of Americans in the hospital with Covid-19 has plummeted by about half to around 47,000 since early September. In Florida, Miami-Dade County's mask mandate could be loosened by the end of October if the encouraging numbers continue, and nearby Broward County will discuss relaxing its requirement on Tuesday. The superintendent in metro Atlanta said he will consider waiving mask requirements at individual schools. A high school outside Boston became the first in Massachusetts to make masks optional after it hit a state vaccination threshold. With about 95% of eligible people at Hopkinton High inoculated, school leaders voted to allow vaccinated students and staff to go maskless for a three-week trial period starting November 1. Still, there are some troubling indicators, including the onset of cold weather, which sends people indoors, where the virus can more easily spread. With required mask use reduced in much of the US, the University of Washington's influential Covid-19 forecasting model is predicting increasing infections and hospitalizations in November. Also, Covid-19 deaths per day have begun to creep back up again after a decline that started in late September. Deaths are running at about 1,700 per day, up from close to 1,500 two weeks ago. The virus is still striking unvaccinated communities, many of them rural areas in states including North Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska and Minnesota. More than 67% of the nation's eligible population is fully vaccinated, and the Biden administration is getting closer to enacting a workplace vaccine mandate for every business in the country with more than 100 employees. In Alaska, which has ranked at or near the top in per-capita case rates over the last month, hospitals remain strained, but health care workers are not speaking out the way they had, said Jared Kosin, president and CEO of the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association. A recent debate over masks in Alaska's largest city, Anchorage, grew heated, and hospital and public health officials last month reported hostilities toward health care workers related to Covid-19. It's not yet clear, he said, if the state has peaked in terms of cases in this latest surge. ""It's not letting up and I think that's the hardest part with this. It's not like you can see hope on the horizon, you know we're going to see a rapid decline and get through it. it just seems to come and go and when it comes it hits really hard."" In sparsely populated Wyoming, which has one of the nation's lowest vaccination rates, hospitals are coping with more patients than at any other point in the pandemic. The vast majority of hospitalized patients in Wyoming haven't gotten the vaccine, the state's vaccination rate is only about 43%. Only West Virginia ranks lower. ""It's like a war zone,"" public health officer Dr. Mark Dowell told a county health board about the situation at Wyoming Medical Center, the Casper Star Tribune reported. ""The ICU is overrun."" In smaller hospitals in North Dakota, many people are getting long-delayed treatments for other ailments, but combined with Covid patients, facilities are pushed to the limit, said Dan Olson, executive director of a network that includes many of those facilities. ""You can talk in the morning and they have beds and by afternoon they might be at capacity,"" Olson said. In rural Minnesota, a man waited two days for an intensive care bed and later died. Bob Cameron, 87, had gone to his hometown hospital in Hallock with severe gastrointestinal bleeding and Covid-19. Officials searched for space in a larger centre. The bleeding exhausted the hospital's blood supply, and state troopers drove 130 miles (209 kilometres) with new units, but his condition worsened after surgery and he died October 13, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. ""We can't say for certain, of course, that if he got to an ICU bed sooner than he would have survived, but we just feel in our hearts that he would have,"" said Cameron's granddaughter, Janna Curry. During a three-week stretch this month, rural hospitals in Minnesota were caring for more Covid-19 patients than those in the state's major urban centre, Minneapolis-St. Paul.",,indiatoday

Officials and elected representatives, who are closely monitoring developments in Myanmar, said that continued clashes between the Army and the civilian groups there forced the people to cross over and seek refuge in the Indian state. An MP from Mizoram said that there are a large number of people waiting across the border to take shelter in Mizoram, while more are likely to come after their harvest season. Data maintained by the CID shows that the Myanmar nationals mostly take shelter in six Mizoram districts ‚Äì Champhai, Lawngtlai, Siaha, Serchhip, Hnahthial and Saitual ‚Äì with Champhai housing the highest number of around 6,000. As many as 1,630 people are in Aizawl.

""The river Tiau (which flows along the Champhai district in eastern Mizoram and divides India and Myanmar) was crossed by the refugees in small boats with the help of local Mizos,"" a Mizoram NGO leader said. ""The hapless people with no option to survive the Army onslaught took shelter in our side and the Mizo villagers on humanitarian ground provided them food and shelter,"" he added. Mizoram shares 510 km international border with Myanmar and 318 km with Bangladesh. Besides Mizoram's most influential NGO Young Mizo Association, various churches including Presbyterian, Baptist and Roman Catholic are, on humanitarian grounds, providing food, essentials, clothing and shelter to the refugees since March. On a number of occasions, Chief Minister Zoramthanga has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide humanitarian assistance to Myanmar nationals as his State is witnessing a continuing influx of refugees from the neighbouring country. Mizoram Planning Board Vice Chairman H. Rammawi, who is closely dealing with the Myanmar refugee affairs, said that the Chief Minister, besides writing letters, has also talked to Prime Minister and Home Minister Amit Shah over phone on a number of occasions, requested them to extend humanitarian assistance to the Myanmar refugees. ""The Central government is yet to respond positively and has remained silent on the issue,"" he said, adding that he has been in constant touch with the External Affairs Ministry and the Home Ministry, and the people of Mizoram are deeply disappointed over the Centre's silence and ""apathetic"" attitude towards the distressed people from Myanmar. He said that the State is now reeling under a severe financial crisis, limited infrastructure of health and other services and non-availability of required manpower, as the COVID pandemic has also badly affected the State's overall situation.

Ryan Strome returns to ice for Rangers after bout with COVID-19,https://nypost.com/2021/10/26/ryan-strome-returns-to-ice-for-rangers-after-bout-with-covid-19/,,['Mollie Walker'],,Ryan Strome cleared the remainder of the NHL‚Äôs COVID-19 protocols and returned to the Rangers lineup against the Flames on Monday night at Madison Square Garden.,Ryan Strome cleared the remainder of the NHL‚Äôs COVID-19 protocols and returned to the Rangers lineup against the Flames on Monday night at Madison Square Garden.,10/26/21 4:50,"Ryan Strome cleared the remainder of the NHL‚Äôs COVID-19 protocols and returned to the Rangers lineup against the Flames on Monday night at Madison Square Garden. Sidelined for the last four games, the 28-year-old center revealed that he tested positive for coronavirus and experienced symptoms ahead of the Rangers‚Äô trip to Canada and Nashville. ‚ÄúIt was nice to be out there, it‚Äôs not fun to miss time,‚Äù Strome said after the sloppy 5-1 loss . ‚ÄúNot really used to it. It was a little bit tough to deal with because I haven‚Äôt really missed many games.‚Äù Despite experiencing symptoms, Strome said he felt good on the ice and didn‚Äôt have any issues with his conditioning. He credited the organization for ensuring that he was up to speed by the time his 10-day stint in COVID-19 protocol was finished, citing the time he spent on the assault bike, eating healthy and getting plenty of rest. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a top-six player for us,‚Äù head coach Gerard Gallant said during his pregame media availability of getting Strome back. ‚Äú[He plays on both] special teams, he‚Äôs an important guy, important guy down the middle for us. He does everything well for us, so when you miss a top guy, you definitely miss him. We were fortunate enough, we went 4-0 without him so that‚Äôll give him a little shot.‚Äù Strome, who won 11 of 12 faceoffs in 19:07 of ice time, slotted right back into his usual second-line spot next to Artemi Panarin and rejoined the Rangers‚Äô first power-play unit. With Panarin back on the second line, Alexis Lafreniere was elevated to the top line alongside Mika Zibanejad and Chris Kreider. Regarding Kaapo Kakko, who has been on injured reserve with an undisclosed upper-body injury, Gallant said he expects the Finnish winger to be ready for Friday‚Äôs matchup with the Blue Jackets. Additionally, Julien Gauthier was inserted back into the lineup for the first time in two games. He skated on the third line next to Filip Chytil and Sammy Blais, while Dryden Hunt, Kevin Rooney and Ryan Reaves made up the fourth unit. Ryan Reaves suffered an undisclosed lower-body injury in the first period Monday night and sat on the bench for the remainder of the game. Gallant didn‚Äôt seem too concerned over Reaves‚Äô injury, saying the bruising forward is ‚Äúdoing fine‚Äù and considered ‚Äúday-to-day.‚Äù Despite his injury, Reaves returned to the Rangers‚Äô bench at the start of the middle frame and stayed to show his support. ‚ÄúHe just wanted to sit on the bench and be part of the group,‚Äù Gallant said. ‚ÄúReavo is a new teammate and he wanted to be there to support them. He was disappointed he couldn‚Äôt play.‚Äù Goalie Igor Shesterkin turned aside 32 of the 37 shots he faced in his fifth start of the season, which also counted as his first regulation loss of the year. After competing in the previous two games, Morgan Barron was assigned to AHL Hartford on Monday to make room for Strome. ‚ÄúEverything was good,‚Äù Gallant said of Barron. ‚ÄúHe worked hard, he competed hard, he did a good job for us. As we all know, there‚Äôs only 23 guys you‚Äôre allowed on your roster. But it was good, he played a real good game the other night for us and worked hard.‚Äù",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/HOCKEY-NHL-NYR-CGY_.jpg?quality=90&strip=all,nypost

Power and McDowell looking to make hay in Bermuda Championship,https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/golf/power-and-mcdowell-looking-to-make-hay-in-bermuda-championship-1.4710079?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"S√©amus Power and Graeme McDowell are among those aiming to make the most of this week‚Äôs Butterfield Bermuda Championship‚Äôs upgrading to a full FedEx Cup points ranking tournament on the PGA Tour, with an enhanced purse of $6 million. Originally scheduled to be a lower-ranked tournament opposite the HSBC Champions tournament in Shanghai, which became a casualty of international travel restrictions due to Covid-19, the Bermuda Championship at Port Royal Golf Club was given enhanced status in a week when the impact of the pandemic on the main professional tours is more apparent than any other time. The HSBC Champions ‚Äì a no cut, limited field tournament which counted on both the PGA and European Tours ‚Äì was last played in 2019 when Rory McIlroy triumphed. Its demise from the schedule for a second straight year due to impacts of Covid travel restrictions has resulted in a hole on the European Tour with no tournament at all as the schedule winds up to its finale in Dubai next month, while at least the PGA Tour has been able to bump up the status of the tournament in Bermuda. However, the Bermuda Championship‚Äôs increased ranking hasn‚Äôt resulted in many of the world‚Äôs very top players adding it onto their itineraries: indeed, the headline act is former Masters champion Patrick Reed, the world number 24; while a number of players who graduated off the Korn Ferry Tour will be aiming to kickstart their campaigns in the 2021-22 wraparound season. Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, said the decision to cancel the HSBC in Shanghai had been ‚Äúunfortunate‚Äù but taken to ‚Äúensure that we abide by the epidemic prevention policies of different markets which may cause inconvenience to the players and make tournament operations very challenging.‚Äù For both Power, 105th in the latest world rankings, and McDowell, who has fallen to 244th, the Bermuda Championship ‚Äì especially so in the absence of so many big names ‚Äì provides the opportunity to claim some early season FedEx Cup points. McDowell‚Äôs knowledge of the course, a Robert Trent Junior design but short by modern standards, dates back to competing there in the Grand Slam of Golf following his US Open win in 2010. Power, for his part, has enjoyed a splendid season highlighted by a breakthrough win on the PGA Tour in the Barbasol Championship ‚Äì which came in a strong run of five top-10s in 11 tournaments ‚Äì and, like McDowell, is set for a stretch of events that will take in Bermuda and the Mayakoba in Mexico next week and on to the Houston Open and the RSM Classic. The cancellation of the HSBC has resulted in a free week on the European Tour, which will resume with next week‚Äôs Portugal Masters before the tour swings into its final stretch in Dubai for two further events, the second of which is the DP World Tour Championship which is confined to the leading 60 available players off the Race to Dubai. P√°draig Harrington has parked his Champions Tour endeavours stateside to one side for the moment and has added the Portugal Masters onto his schedule. Currently 68th on the Race to Dubai standings, the 50-year-old Dubliner needs to move into the top-60 if he is to tee up alongside many of his Ryder Cup team (and a number of US Ryder Cuppers who have taken out European Tour cards) for the Tour Championship. As things stand, Shane Lowry and Rory McIlroy are the only Irish players qualified for the tour finale in the desert. There is no tournament on the Challenge Tour either this week, which will see a season‚Äôs finale in next week‚Äôs Grand Final of the Road to Mallorca. Unfortunately, no Irish player has managed to make it to the final tournament where ultimately 20 cards for next year‚Äôs European Tour will be dispensed. John Murphy, though, has secured a full Challenge Tour card for the 2021 season. The 23-year-old Corkman, who turned professional after the Walker Cup and completing his studies at the University of Louisville, and despite playing a limited schedule, finished 69th on the Challenge Tour order of merit which will ensure he can map out his own itinerary on the secondary tour next season. With no tournament on the LPGA Tour this week, Leona Maguire will resume action in two weeks time at the Pelican Championship in Belleair, Florida before finishing the season at the following week‚Äôs limited field CME Group‚Äôs Tour Championship.",,10/26/21 5:00,"S√©amus Power and Graeme McDowell are among those aiming to make the most of this week‚Äôs Butterfield Bermuda Championship‚Äôs upgrading to a full FedEx Cup points ranking tournament on the PGA Tour, with an enhanced purse of $6 million.

Power, for his part, has enjoyed a splendid season highlighted by a breakthrough win on the PGA Tour in the Barbasol Championship ‚Äì which came in a strong run of five top-10s in 11 tournaments ‚Äì and, like McDowell, is set for a stretch of events that will take in Bermuda and the Mayakoba in Mexico next week and on to the Houston Open and the RSM Classic. The cancellation of the HSBC has resulted in a free week on the European Tour, which will resume with next week‚Äôs Portugal Masters before the tour swings into its final stretch in Dubai for two further events, the second of which is the DP World Tour Championship which is confined to the leading 60 available players off the Race to Dubai. P√°draig Harrington has parked his Champions Tour endeavours stateside to one side for the moment and has added the Portugal Masters onto his schedule. Currently 68th on the Race to Dubai standings, the 50-year-old Dubliner needs to move into the top-60 if he is to tee up alongside many of his Ryder Cup team (and a number of US Ryder Cuppers who have taken out European Tour cards) for the Tour Championship. As things stand, Shane Lowry and Rory McIlroy are the only Irish players qualified for the tour finale in the desert. There is no tournament on the Challenge Tour either this week, which will see a season‚Äôs finale in next week‚Äôs Grand Final of the Road to Mallorca. Unfortunately, no Irish player has managed to make it to the final tournament where ultimately 20 cards for next year‚Äôs European Tour will be dispensed. John Murphy, though, has secured a full Challenge Tour card for the 2021 season. The 23-year-old Corkman, who turned professional after the Walker Cup and completing his studies at the University of Louisville, and despite playing a limited schedule, finished 69th on the Challenge Tour order of merit which will ensure he can map out his own itinerary on the secondary tour next season. With no tournament on the LPGA Tour this week, Leona Maguire will resume action in two weeks time at the Pelican Championship in Belleair, Florida before finishing the season at the following week‚Äôs limited field CME Group‚Äôs Tour Championship.",https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4710078.1635173896!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg,irishtimes

What is the ‚Äòright to disconnect‚Äô? How legislation could help with work-life balance,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2021/10/25/canada-right-to-disconnect-legislation/,,['Lisa Steacy'],,"What if workers had the ‚Äúright to disconnect?‚Äù It‚Äôs something that could become law in Ontario, is already enshrined in several European countries, and could gain even more traction as people across the country continue to work from home.

The legislation proposed in Ontario Monday requires companies with more than 25 employees to develop policies that promote disconnecting from work, making it easier to create and maintain boundaries, eliminating some of the pressure to respond to every text, email, Slack notification, or Zoom invite that pops up on an employee‚Äôs smartphone. It‚Äôs a first-of-its-kind proposition in this country. France pioneered this legislation in 2016 after a study found 37 per cent of workers were using their work phones or laptops outside of business hours and that 62 per cent of workers wanted to see this regulated. It's something many struggle with ‚Äì disconnecting from work. The Ford govt says worker protections are on the way that could see employees stressing less about emails when they're off the clock ‚Äì dubbing it the 'right to disconnect' legislation. @CityNewsVAN #CityNewsEverywhere pic.twitter.com/Ycd64UoUC0 ‚Äî Tarnjit Kaur Parmar (@Tarnjitkparmar) October 26, 2021 Policies can include expectations around response time for emails, clearly defining what working hours are, and encouraging employees to turn on out-of-office notifications when they aren‚Äôt on the clock. RELATED: ‚ÄòRight to disconnect‚Äô bill to promote work-life balance: Ontario labour minister The idea has been touted as something that could create more equitable workplace opportunities, reduce burnout, and help companies retain workers, according to Fiona McQuarrie, retired professor of business administration at the University of the Fraser Valley. ‚ÄúThe idea has come up because the ways that we can do work now are more wide-ranging than just coming into an office and sitting down at nine o‚Äôclock and then getting up and leaving at five o‚Äôclock,‚Äù she explains, noting the notion of work-life balance became more widely discussed decades ago with the advent of email and cell phones. ‚ÄúBefore there were all these different ways to contact workers, to have people work outside of working hours or outside of the physical workplace, there was a much stronger disconnect between the workplace and home life. I think the idea behind the ‚Äúright to disconnect‚Äù is to try to bring that back in some form, to re-establish some boundaries between work and home because of the psychological importance of that division.‚Äù Not all workers equally able to be available during off hours But while everyone may feel the pressure to be constantly available, McQuarrie notes not all people have the same demands on their time or the same technology available after hours. ‚ÄúIf everybody is operating on the same expectation ‚Äî that work ends when work hours end ‚Äî it could be quite effective in making a more equitable workplace,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúIf that expectation is established of people being available beyond regular work hours or even 24/7, obviously that privileges certain people who don‚Äôt have commitments outside of work like families, or elders or children to take care of or other commitments. So it would even the playing field a bit more, for sure.‚Äù Even if the expectation of off-hours availability isn‚Äôt explicit, it can easily creep in, McQuarrie says. For example, if someone replies to an email while eating dinner, then someone else sends an answer to that before they go to bed, then another colleague chimes in first thing in the morning ‚Äî the overall effect is a workplace that is communicating constantly. ‚ÄúOne thing that putting in the right to disconnect would help cut down on, is to stop those cycles of responses and information being exchanged. They kind of build on each other and end up building a culture of availability even if consciously, that was not what was intended.‚Äù RELATED: Finding right balance with remote work can reduce burnout, experts say Another thing to consider, according to McQuarrie, is that a workplace with employees who never stop working isn‚Äôt necessarily more productive. She points to one study done with consultants as an example. ‚ÄúWorkers were more satisfied, they were more productive because they were more focused, and also because they had time to do other things. Being available 24/7 theoretically is great, but if all you‚Äôre thinking about is work eventually ‚Äî that catches up with you. We need to do different things in our lives we need to have different experiences and we need a break,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúPutting in the requirement that work would be done within these hours but not outside those hours, turned out also to have really good benefits for the organization. It helped them reduce their turnover and it helped to retain employees longer.‚Äù RELATED: Working mothers feeling the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic stress, fatigue, burnout The pandemic sent swaths of office workers home, while making work even more taxing for so many working in essential services. McQuarrie says this has and will continue to transform the way we think about work as the economy recovers. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going through a phase where some very fundamental assumptions about work have been challenged,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe found out that there are some jobs that you can‚Äôt do from home. We‚Äôve also found out that if you‚Äôre working from home, and your computer is sitting on your dining room table and you can see it every minute you‚Äôre awake, that‚Äôs kind of overwhelming for some people and it‚Äôs not healthy for them.‚Äù Related Video: The federal government is considering giving federally regulated employees the right to disconnect and had a consultation earlier this year. No legislation has been proposed yet. One of the key reasons the consultation was being done was due to the pandemic. ‚ÄúRecent surveys have shown that workers have been adapting to this new way of working. However, many workers have reported increased issues with ‚Äòswitching off‚Äô at the end of the workday. Expectations about being able to disconnect at the end of the day are more important than ever. This is due to the fact more and more Canadians are making their home their workplace,‚Äù a backgrounder on the issue reads. For McQuarrrie, improving working conditions for people in low-paid jobs is paramount. ‚ÄúThere are more fundamental issues that need to be addressed in labour legislation like more paid sick leave,‚Äù she says, noting Ontario has not committed to giving workers time off, or raised the minimum wage. ‚ÄúSomething like the right to disconnect in labour legislation, it certainly could be a very positive thing, but if people are still being paid substandard wages and being exploited by their employers ‚Äî the right to disconnect is kind of window dressing.‚Äù",10/26/21 5:42,,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/9/2015/06/17/iStock_000021823117Large-e1434561783140-1024x579.jpg,citynews1130

""No Mandate Monday"" may be coming to a school near you. Some students and teachers at a California high school on Monday took part in a loosely organized protest called "" No Mandate Monday"" that is aimed to rebuke Sacramento over its COVID-19 classroom dictates and stand up for a senior removed from campus last week for refusing to wear a mask. Video emerged from inside Ponderosa High School that showed maskless students taking part in the protest who had been placed into a ""non-compliance room,"" according to one parent. Michael Wilkes, 38, a teacher at the El Dorado County high school, told Fox News he was put on administrative paid leave after spending the day teaching lessons without a mask. He said the district is conducting an investigation and he will likely lose his job after five years. CLICK FOR THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS ""I have tremendous peace of mind knowing that I‚Äôm living true to my heart,"" he said. Wilkes, a father of three young children, said he has received an outpour of support from families from within the district who agree that these mandates handed down from Sacramento do more harm than good when it comes to the health and learning environment for children.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Getty) California has a statewide mask requirement that affects about 6.7 million students. The state‚Äôs largest teachers' unions support the mandate, as does the California Association of School Boards. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the state‚Äôs Democrat, said students will have to be vaccinated to attend in-person classes once the U.S. has fully vetted the vaccines for the particular age groups. His office did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News. Wilkes said it was his intention to stand up for individual freedoms and encourage debate during his classes. He said parents are growing tired of these mandates and pointed to last week‚Äôs protest in Sacramento as evidence. The protest included parents who lashed out against the Newsom vaccine mandate. VIRAL POST The video of the protesting students emerged Monday on Let Them Breathe ‚Äôs Twitter handle. ""HAPPENING RIGHT NOW,"" the post read. ""46 STUDENTS CHOSE TO UNMASK with the support of some teachers but are being kept in two separate rooms by admin at Ponderosa High School with instruction in El Dorado County CA. They sent us this video and asked us to share this developing situation."" Reopen California Schools , a volunteer group, posted that the ""No-Mask Mondays"" was formed in protest after a student ""who couldn‚Äôt wear one was disciplined because of our state‚Äôs indefinite school mask mandate."" Wilkes said the senior at the high school, who he described as a ""straight-A angel,"" decided to take off the facial covering and attempt to enter classrooms last week. She was eventually removed from the campus, he said. It was not immediately clear precisely how many students and teachers at the school took part in the protest. Ponderosa High School's principal and the school district did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News.

(Hector Amezcua/The Sacramento Bee via AP) (Hector Amezcua/The Sacramento Bee via AP) Jonathan Zachreson, the founder of Reopen California Schools, said he started his push to get students back inside the classroom when schools in the state first closed to in-person classes back in 2020. He said although the state has reopened schools, these mandates continue to take a toll on the children. ""So much has been taken from kids this past 18 months,"" he said. ""We need to give them back some normalcy."" At the heart of the protest are the mask and vaccine mandates. The argument from parents opposed to vaccines for children is that the long-term side effects of these jabs are still unknown. They also say these mandates infringe upon their freedoms. Opponents of these calls to protest see those who refuse to wear masks as reckless and willing to jeopardize the public's health to make a political statement. Federal health regulators said Friday that kid-size doses of Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine appear highly effective at preventing symptomatic infections in elementary school children and caused no unexpected safety issues. The Food and Drug Administration posted its analysis of Pfizer‚Äôs data ahead of a public meeting this week to debate whether the shots are ready for the nation‚Äôs roughly 28 million children ages five to 11. The agency will ask a panel of outside vaccine experts to vote on that question. FDA scientists concluded that in almost every scenario the vaccine‚Äôs benefit for preventing hospitalizations and death from COVID-19 would outweigh any serious potential side effects in children. But agency reviewers stopped short of calling for Pfizer‚Äôs shot to be authorized. Health officials have also insisted that masks--worn properly-- has been proven effective in limiting the disease's spread in indoor settings. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Wilkes said he also has support from other teachers who would otherwise speak out but are concerned about losing their jobs. But he said he will continue to hold his ground. ""This has become bigger than masks, bigger than the vaccine,"" he said. ""It's about individual liberty and the parents being able to make decisions for their children.""
