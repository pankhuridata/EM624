EX07: Comparing text
Assignment Specification
The website ProCon.org is collecting some of the most controversial issues in our society. They collect and publish both Pro & Cons quotes and readers’ comments.
Peak one of the following controversial issues, select/copy/paste the Pro & Cons in 2 separate txt files for analysis.
Controversial issues:
 American Socialism
 Binge-Watching
 Dress Codes
 Space Colonization
Copy the pro and con from the website and paste them in 2 separate txt files.
Goal of this assignment is to compare the 2 positions (Pro/Con) via the related texts.
In order to perform the comparison, you will write a Python script to extract key information and then add a layer of interpretation.
You need to create the txt files first, by separately selecting the pro and con, copy, paste them in a text editor and save the 2 files as txt. A preliminary cleaning (before saving the files) is recommended. 
Please refer to what presented in class for examples.

Once you have the files, the script will do the following:
 Clean the texts by removing
o the stopwords, using the attached stopwords_en.txt file
o words shorter than 3 characters
o all the words that are obviously frequently used (like the name of the issue)
o the punctuation
o end-of-line (“/n”) and blank lines
 Using the library "vader", calculate the sentiment for the 2 texts 
 Extract bigrams
 Create word clouds for the 2 texts.
Once you performed all the above steps, write a report with your conclusions.
