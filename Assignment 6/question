Exercise: Bokeh Plots 
 
Description: This program will create four plots from data in a matrix (list of lists or pandas). 

Input: is the file SSE_Faculty.csv, containing the courses taught by the faculty of the School of Systems 
and Enterprises from Spring '19 to Spring '23 (modified version of the actual data). 
Per each Academic Year, there is "Load" (number of classes taught by the faculty); "Target" (number of 
classes the faculty was assigned to teach); "Balance" (Load - Target). 
 
Output: Some statistical values and four html files with one plot each. 
See details in the Procedure. 

Procedure: 
1.  Open and read SSE_Faculty.csv into either a list of lists or pandas. 

2.  Calculate and print the following: 
o  Number of courses per each program per each Academic Year 
o  Average number of courses per faculty per Academic Year 
o  Number of underloaded faculty per each Academic Year 
o  Number of overloaded faculty per each Academic Year 

3.  Using Bokeh, create the following 4 plots: 
o  Courses per program per Academic Year 
•  Line Plot 
•  Label the y-axis “Courses” 
•  Add a legend with the names of the programs 
o  Average number of courses per faculty over the years 
•  Bar Plot 
•  Label the x-axis “ID” 
•  Label the y-axis with the number of courses 
o  Number of underloaded faculty over the years 
•  Line Plot 
•  Label the x-axis with the years 
•  Label the y-axis "ID" 
o  Courses by program in '22-'23 
•  Pie chart 
•  Label the wedges (names = 'EM', 'SSW', 'SYS') 
 
You will submit the .py with your script.
